Neither should be missed, nor should this episode... so quit reading the synopsis and watch it already!",

We were nominated for SIX awards (Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Direction, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, and Best Actor - Dug)... we won NOTHING. As is the case with all good awards ceremonies, another movie swept the event. Either way, we had a blast making it, and you can expect to see another Team Moxie film in next year's challenge.",
