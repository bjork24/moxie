  "body": "This was Team Moxie's official entry in the 2006 S.A.T.O. 48 hour film challenge. You might recognize many of the actors as Moxie employees, and Dug, who plays Stone, as the guy who's always standing around drinking in the back of the Cinebar. We were nominated for SIX awards (Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Direction, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, and Best Actor - Dug)... we won NOTHING. As is the case with all good awards ceremonies, another movie swept the event. Either way, we had a blast making it, and you can expect to see another Team Moxie film in next year's challenge.",
