I had to bite down on a knife every time I picked it up.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/122_img00127vc.jpg\" /><br/><br/>We see this scenario played out on a daily basis: Bogey enters room with vacuum, vacuum corners Bogey, Bogey freezes until he eventually pees himself. Poor pup.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/123_img00150hi.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Even with 8/9 of our stuff packed up, I still find time to check my e-mail. If I remember correctly, I was reading a message about \"intensifying my anatomy\". I assumed they were referring to my buttocks, so I ordered 4 bottles.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/124_img00124qc.jpg\" /><br/><br/>These are the lights that hang out in our new kitchen. Who wants to take bets on how long it takes before I hit my head on the lowest bulb? Too late. I just did. Twice.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/125_img00530su.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's me applying the 8th coat of paint to the guest bedroom. It looks like I'm cupping a piece of cardboard over my crotch, but that's really another paintbrush. Seriously. Look closer. As you can see, the \"anatomy intensification\" pills are already working their magic.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/126_img00123ot.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Behold! Once I move in my computer stuff, this room will be the new headquarters for Moxie Cinema International. Woo hoo!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/127_img00120rr.jpg\" /><br/><br/>This is our new bathroom. Nicole likes it because we painted it a nice dark blue. I like it because our neighbors can watch me make water.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/128_img00123js.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's the newly formed Moxie Cinema International Headquarters. As you can see, I need to do a little organizing, but fret not! I know where everything is.",
