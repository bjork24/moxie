  "body": "This phlog is from our recent trip up to Columbia for the True/False Film Festival, which has become, in its two year existence, the preeminent documentary film festival in the Midwest, if not the nation. Many thanks to Paul and David for giving Nicole and I all-access passes to the festival, and to Justin and Kelley for giving us all-access passes to the bed in their guest bedroom. Gracias amigos!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/20_a5tm.jpg\" /><br/><br/>This is the beautiful Missouri Theater, which lives right down the street from Ragtag. Out of the four films we saw last weekend, three were here. These shots were taken just before the opening night film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436613/\" target=\"_blank\">Murderball</a>, which was an AWESOME film.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/21_b2vo.jpg\" /><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.gillioz.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Gillioz</a>, which is the historic 1,100 seat theater right down the road from the Moxie, will look like this one day. I can't wait!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/22_c1ez.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Look at them purty winders!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/23_d8rq.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's a blurry picture of the creative minds behind <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436613/\" target=\"_blank\">Murderball</a>. From left: the moderator (I forgot his name), co-director and co-producer Dana Adam Shapiro, co-director Henry Alex Rubin (who I got to meet, and who Nicole has a serious crush on), and producer Jeff Mandel.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/24_e1yf.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Ah, the Ragtag. The spark that created the Moxie. Here's a nice shot of the front of their auditorium and the screen. NOTE: The screen is a standard pull-down projector screen, not a prefab, sized movie screen... hmm, not a bad idea. Also, the speakers are mounted on the walls beside and above the screen, as opposed to behind it, thus freeing up a foot and a half of space between the front row and the screen.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/25_f2di.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Black ceiling. Track lighting. Beautiful!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/26_g4mf.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's some artwork on the walls. Notice the color scheme: red, black, white. Sound familiar? Also, the bathroom - the ONLY bathroom - is located just to the left of the frame... INSIDE the auditorium. Pretty cool, eh?!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/27_h3wy.jpg\" /><br/><br/>More artwork, but check out the wall behind it. It's the same bumpy, plaster that we have in our building. Hooray!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/28_i5ov.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Couches and chairs, some more comfortable than others, but very cool nonetheless.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/29_j3iz.jpg\" /><br/><br/>This church is referred to as the Donald Duck church. Can you see why?<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/30_k2xe.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's Nicole cradling Abbey, Justin and Kelley's cat. What a cute picture.",

Then again, who am I, you know?<br/><br/>You SHOULD, however, look into some more artwork like on the bumpy plaster wall.  \"failure.\"  it just makes me smile.",
