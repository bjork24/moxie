Each distributor required us to complete a credit application and master licensing agreement. Some of the forms were smallish (2 to 3 pages), others were heart-attack-inducing-ish (30+ pages, not including addendums). Nicole made color folders for each studio.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/17_pic28ww.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nI'm talking on my cell phone, but you can't see it. Why, you ask? Because it's invisible. Would you look at all that hair!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/18_pic32ro.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nOne of the distributors was kind enough to supply us with a S.A.S.E. - Silver Almond Syrup Extractor. This is a picture of an envelope.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/19_pic41he.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nAfter the horror and carnage of the distribution forms, our friend Mora stopped by to accompany me on piano. I believe we were signing \"Killing Me Softly\" in this shot. \"<i>I hate it when they close their eyes.</i>\"\r\n",
