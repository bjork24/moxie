  "body": "Yes. Yes it is.\r\n\r\nAfter picking up our new digital projector, I was ultra pumped to try it out. The first \"official\" test was my DVD of Bjork videos... <i>Pagan Poetry</i> to be exact. If you've seen the video, you know why I chose it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/digital_projector_1.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nSince Bjork's videos were 4:3 ratio, the next test was to see how well a widescreen DVD would look. I decided to use <i>Lost in Translation</i>, but don't ass me why.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/digital_projector_2.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere's a shot of me measuring Bill Murray's ego.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/digital_projector_3.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere's what the blog looks like at seven feet six inches across. I immediately queued up some internet porn after Nicole put the camera away.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/digital_projector_4.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere I am teaching Bogey the fine art of shadow puppetry. I'm demonstrating the famous \"man leaning towards wall\" puppet, while Bogey strains his tail to get it into the light. \"Damnit,\" Bogey says. \"Will my tail ever be long enough?\"",
