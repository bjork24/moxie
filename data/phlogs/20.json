  "body": "While dad was busying himself with the Cinebar arch, I had my hands full with REAL work. For instance:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Finishing the trim below the window.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>See this hole...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>... and this virtual chasm between the two sheets of glass?<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>With a little silicone and a big caulk gun... BAM!!! Problem solved.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>I'm still congratulating myself on how well I sealed the space between the windows. I mean, seriously. You couldn't pay someone to apply silicone that masterfully... not even Pamela Anderson's plastic surgeon could touch this.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The big hole was more of a squirt job, but it'll clear up in a couple days. I briefly considered making that last sentence sound a little less sexually ambiguous... briefly.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Remember the doorway that leads to the prep room? Well, you should, because I talked all about it in <a href=\"/phlogs/18\">an old phlog</a>. Remember now? Good. When we began, the doorway looked very much like an entrance to a cave, so it was my job to take a chisel and chip away at the concrete for hours on end. Why? Who knows. I didn't have anything better to do.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Breaking the cave rock off the floor was the worst. I considered chiseling my toes off at one point.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects9.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>After the chiseling was done, it was time to build a steady frame out of 2x4's... sweet, sweet 2x4's.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects10.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>See how the frame is slowly coming together... it's amazing, really. You should also note the reinstalled burglar alarm and telephone interface above the frame. Remember how it took me several hours to take it all down? Well, it took just as long to put it back up. I had to dismantle all the wires in the burglar alarm, draw out a rudimentary schematic so I wouldn't forget where they went, and then rewire the whole thing. I again considered chiseling my toes off.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects11.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Woops! I forgot to photograph a few of the steps between this picture and the last one. As you can see, I finished the frame and stuck a couple pieces of sheetrock to the ceiling of the walk-through. Then I screwed a bunch of wood to the concrete wall surrounding the cave entrance. Dad cut a few pieces of sheet rock...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects12.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's a closer view. You can see the additional framing behind the sheetrock.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects13.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>I applied the final pieces of sheetrock...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects14.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>... and that, my friends, is how you turn a nasty cave hole into a nice walk-through.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/dans_projects15.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>In conclusion, never apply your entire body weight to your hammer when trying to remove a rusty nail from a piece of solid Walnut. That's not what happened here, though. I did this with my bare hands.",
