See a difference? That's right! Bogey's not in the picture, and Nicole is wearing gray pants instead of brown ones. WALLS! We have walls! Walls! WALLS!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/walls3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This will be the screen wall. The big duct that runs along the left side of the auditorium is going to be moved about a foot futher to the left (until it's touching the West wall). Also, the smaller duct that runs left to right will be moved behind the wall, thus freeing up the entire wall - from big duct to column - for the screen.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/walls4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This will be the aisle way down the right side of the auditorium. The chairs will run from the column to the wall.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/walls5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is where the exit door will be for the auditorium.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/walls6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is a rather pointless picture, but hey... what can I say?<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/walls7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This will be the \"art hall.\" All the artwork will hang on the wall to the left... maybe on the auditorium wall too. We haven't decided yet.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/walls8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's the Walnut Street entrance. It's not as tight as I had originally thought it would be... tight as in space-wise, not coolness.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/walls9.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is the corner of the screen wall. I'm going to build a recessed cubby for the backstage speaker so we can get the screen as close as possible to the wall. That might not make sense right now, but it will in subsequent phlogs.",
