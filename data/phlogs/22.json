  "body": "The Cinebar construction continued full-force this weekend, and here's the proof:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>To separate the back half of the concession area (box office) from the front (Cinebar), dad decided to build an arched dividing wall. Step one was to build a continuing \"joist\" to attach the arches to. NOTE: I cut the arches all by myself!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's a shot from the back, exposing the sweet, sweet 2x6's.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's Nicole examining the pipes above the box office. NOTE: While Nicole was looking up, the backside of the arch miraculously cloned another piece.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>SEE! Now the arch is double-sided, immediately making it twice as cool. Nicole is practicing her \"pseudo-celebrity doesn't have time for photos\" pose.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's an upskirt shot of the arch (NSFW!). More 2x6 hotness!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>What's that? A solid Cedar beam? That wasn't there before! Wait a minute... what <i>was</i> there before? Oh yeah, a broken piece of wall. (*knock* *knock* *knock*) Hey! That's not solid... it's just boxed in! You lied to me, Dan. Damn you!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Once the arch was built, we had to do something about all that space above it. Dad wanted to frame it in and install a backlit window with the Moxie's logo painted across it. While I agree that the window would look really cool, we still need a place to stick our menu. What's that? Stick it where?!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>So the space was framed in...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession9.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>... and sheetrocked.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession10.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's a shot from the box office area. We're going to install a drop ceiling just above the arch, so you won't see anything higher up than that.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession11.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The final of piece of sheetrock was applied, and VOILA! The Cinebar is one step closer to completion.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession12.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>To hide the broken, jagged pieces of wall that surrounded the vault, dad devised this little trick. He called it \"cedar framing.\" Don't worry, everything's going to be painted over...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/050205/concession13.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's a close-up of the fine woodworking craftsmanship. Dad cut that out with a jigsaw. I think I'm going to paint the <a href=\"http://www.classicgaming.com/tmk/images/ss/ss_smb_07.gif\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">cloud that throws stuff at you</a> from Super Mario Brothers over the top.",
