This is their story.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Hey! We're a pile of steel studs. We weren't that expensive a few years ago, but thanks to the war in Iraq and an increase in Chinese steel consumption, we're now TOTALLY expensive. AWESOME!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Check us out! We're all tall and stuff.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Isn't that pretty? We can make a wall like no other.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>That's an aluminum track. Kinda like a baseboard, but not... because it's made out of aluminum... and it's not a board.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>We're like totally all over the place, dude!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Nice shadows, Dan. What exactly are we looking at here? Idiot!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>I'm telling you, man... once we get some sheetrock up in this bitch... dude... totally.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Hey! Those aren't steel studs. That's a door frame! Made out of wood! Totally bogus, Dan. Way, way heinous!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/052005/steel9.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>There we are on the floor... rocking and rolling. In time, we will be a most triumphant booth wall. Catch you later!",
