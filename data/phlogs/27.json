  "body": "These pictures were taken over a span of a month. The goal was to turn an old shelving unit and wood burning stove into a big black mess. Mission accomplished!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's the \"before\" shot. Notice the rotten shelf leg towards the lower left and the old stove on the right. The white thing in the upper-center of the picture is a towel shoved into the stove-pipe hole. Classy!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Step 1: Saw off the rotten shelf leg.<br/>Step 2: Scream like a woman when a big centipede runs out.<br/>Step 3: Kill centipede with jigsaw (sorry PETA)<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Amazingly, the shelf is still standing after I lopped off its leg... kind of like that knight in that one Monty Python skit. Classic!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's the new support I built for the shelf. It's made out of a lower shelf that was never featured in any of the pictures. Why? Because I hate that lower shelf. Always have, always will.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>After ripping the rotten wood out from under the stove, I was met face-on by a cloud of black mold. It was terrible. I should be dead, really.<br/><br/>Why did I eat it?<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>With a few pieces of quarter inch plywood and some ripped 2x4's, I was able to turn the once useful wood stove into a useless wooden column! Yay for progress!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>If there's one thing I do well, it's cutting and nailing trim.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>After adding additional support to the shelves (see all the 2x4's!), I stood back and wondered, \"<i>What would really make this wonderful shelving unit come together?</i>\"<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf9.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>A buttload of black paint! Classy! Hey, at least now it <i>looks</i> clean.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/061905/shelf10.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here are some holes in the wall. I leaned against them once and a bunch of squid-like tentacles came through the holes and started going through my pockets. I haven't seen my Altoids since!",
