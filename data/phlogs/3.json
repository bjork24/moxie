Hilarity ensued!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/107_pic2gw.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nWe used this handy little laser level to determine the slope of the auditorium floor. Nicole thinks it kind of looks like Darth Vader. I think she's right.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/108_pic1ar.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nOnce the basic measurements were made, it was time to start putting down tape where we wanted the walls to be built.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/109_pic1cd.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nI'm widely regarded as the fastest taper in the West. West of the camera and East of that wall.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110_pic9jy.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere's me pondering whether I should eat the jelly bean that I spotted in the corner. I'm also banging out the drum solo from the Beatle's \"The End\" with only one hand!",
