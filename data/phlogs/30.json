Hell, it's not even ideal for cassette tapes! *rim shot* Here's how we went about leveling the floor, with some HVAC pictures thrown in for good measure.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/cement1.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThe biggest dip was in the concession area... but enough about my dad! Ha ha ha! I kill me. Here's old man Dan \"floating\" a massive amount of concrete in the Cinebar area. Thanks to his handy work, the only person who will have frequent falls in the Cinebar will be me.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/cement2.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nMore floating.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/cement3.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's a couple examples of my handy work. This was a hole I filled near the lady's restroom.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/cement4.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis was another hole I filled in the doorway of the projection booth. There were many more examples, but I don't want to bore you.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/hvac1.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nNo, that's not an attacking tripod from <i>War of the Worlds</i> - it's a massive heap of HVAC. Somewhere in that tangled mess of duct and insulation... lies a... heart... of... I forgot what I was going to say.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/hvac2.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHey! Check it out! It's the exhaust vent for the projection booth. Could these pictures get any more exciting?!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/hvac3.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis is the giant exhaust hole for the giant heat exchanger that sits atop the giant lady's restroom. It's just big enough to hold three adolescent boys and a buffalo nickel. Anybody catch the reference???\r\n\r\nThat blurry bit in the lower left corner is the arm of the <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?q=michelin%20man\" target=\"_blank\">Michelin Man</a>. He happened to be running by just as I snapped this picture.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/hvac4.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis is the intake hole. The end.",
