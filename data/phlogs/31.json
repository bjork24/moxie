  "body": "This is the phlog everyone's been waiting for. The one where you finally, finally, FINALLY get to see the theater start to come together. Enough talking, here are the pictures:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is how much sheetrock it takes to turn a bunch of wood into a theater.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>And this is how much mud it takes to finish the aforementioned sheetrock.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Does this look familiar? It's the art gallery hallway between the Walnut entrance and the Cinebar. This is what it looked like the day before the sheetrock was hung.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>And this is what it looked like the day after the sheetrock was hung.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>And this is pretty much what it looks like now, after three applications of mud have been applied and sanded.<br/><br/>NOTE: I'm going to show a series of progression shots which won't need much explanation beyond a simple location description. Buckle up!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's the door into the auditorium.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The fabled speakerboxx!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock8_a.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock9.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock10.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Inside the projection booth.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock11.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock12.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock13.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The vaulted ceiling for the projector.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock14.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock15.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The exhaust fan inside the projection booth.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock16.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock17.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock18.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Inside the auditorium, looking back at the projector port.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock19.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock20.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock21.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is me demonstrating how high the port is from the auditorium floor. The center point of the port is 8 feet off the ground, but the lens will sit roughly 2 or 3 inches higher. Not too shabby, eh?<br/><br/>Check out my magical glowing shoe!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock22.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The auditorium gets nice and dark, even without doors!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock23.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's the screen wall.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock24.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock25.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock26.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>I added an extra layer of soundboard and sheetrock to the inside of the speakboxx today. I wanted to make sure there was as little sound leakage as possible into the hallway. The sheetrocking crew will most definitely mock my mudding job tomorrow.<br/><br/><i>¡Él es un tonto de mudding!</i><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock27.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's the Cinebar wall, complete with electrical conduit.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock28.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Dad and I installed all the sheetrock in the Cinebar area.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock29.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>And mudded it.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock30.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>And sanded it.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock31.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This was what the floor of the auditorium looked like a couple days ago. Can anyone say \"MOXIE BLOG CLEANING PARTY?!\" Woo hoo!",

Mud is an all-purpose joint compound that blends in the seams and screw holes. Once everything's been mudded and sanded a few times, the walls are ready to paint.",
