  "body": "This is the phlog everyone's been waiting for. The one where you finally, finally, FINALLY get to see the theater start to come together. Enough talking, here are the pictures:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock1.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis is how much sheetrock it takes to turn a bunch of wood into a theater.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock2.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd this is how much mud it takes to finish the aforementioned sheetrock.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock3.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nDoes this look familiar? It's the art gallery hallway between the Walnut entrance and the Cinebar. This is what it looked like the day before the sheetrock was hung.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock4.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd this is what it looked like the day after the sheetrock was hung.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock5.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd this is pretty much what it looks like now, after three applications of mud have been applied and sanded.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I'm going to show a series of progression shots which won't need much explanation beyond a simple location description. Buckle up!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock6.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's the door into the auditorium.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock7.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock8.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThe fabled speakerboxx!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock8_a.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock9.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock10.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nInside the projection booth.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock11.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock12.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock13.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThe vaulted ceiling for the projector.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock14.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock15.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThe exhaust fan inside the projection booth.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock16.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock17.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock18.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nInside the auditorium, looking back at the projector port.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock19.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock20.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock21.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis is me demonstrating how high the port is from the auditorium floor. The center point of the port is 8 feet off the ground, but the lens will sit roughly 2 or 3 inches higher. Not too shabby, eh?\r\n\r\nCheck out my magical glowing shoe!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock22.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThe auditorium gets nice and dark, even without doors!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock23.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's the screen wall.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock24.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock25.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock26.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nI added an extra layer of soundboard and sheetrock to the inside of the speakboxx today. I wanted to make sure there was as little sound leakage as possible into the hallway. The sheetrocking crew will most definitely mock my mudding job tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<i>¡Él es un tonto de mudding!</i>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock27.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's the Cinebar wall, complete with electrical conduit.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock28.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nDad and I installed all the sheetrock in the Cinebar area.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock29.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd mudded it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock30.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd sanded it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/shitrock31.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis was what the floor of the auditorium looked like a couple days ago. Can anyone say \"MOXIE BLOG CLEANING PARTY?!\" Woo hoo!",

Mud is an all-purpose joint compound that blends in the seams and screw holes. Once everything's been mudded and sanded a few times, the walls are ready to paint.",
