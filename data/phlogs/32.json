  "body": "Despite <a href=\"/phlogs/13\">all the work we did to it</a>, the wall along the west side of the auditorium still looked like crap. Since there was a little sheetrock left over from the auditorium encasing, we decided to slap it up on the wall and make some faux wainscoting. Here's the proof:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Step one was to rip down a superfluous column that was marring the wall between the winders (hillbilly for \"windows\"). I scored the column along the edges and pulled that sucker clean off!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is what the wall looked like after the fight. Dan one, column three.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>From a distance, the column looks slight and unassuming, but once you move in a little closer...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>WHAMMY!!! Enough rusty nails and screws to decimate the entire Roman army! That's ate up, right there... I tell you what!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The next step was to clean all the old mortar, dirt, dust, termite poo, tourniquets, used syringes, and Taco Bell wrappers out of the terrazzo lip.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Look at that. I mean... seriously. Have you ever seen such a clean gap behind a terrazzo lip? Well. Have you?! I didn't think so.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>So here it is. The wall. Ugly, isn't it?<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Channeling the spirit of Bob Villa, Dad turned a plain jane 2x4x12 into a nice terrazzo cap using only his router and a trained beaver named Nibblers.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall9.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Then we put this piece of sheetrock on the wall...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall10.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Then this one...<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/071005/wall11.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>And then this one. And that's how it's done. We'll be putting a piece of trim all along the top a little later. That's all.",
