These are the pictures.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/082005/curtain1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>We were originally going to use black denim, but my uncle (seen here) happened to get his hands on several bolts of fire retardant fabric that matched our color scheme. The fabric was intended for a theater, but one of the bolts was damaged during shipment, so the whole lot was sold for dirt cheap. I really like it.<br/><br/>Sometimes I kiss it.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/082005/curtain2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is my aunt Diane, phenomenal seamstress, sewing our curtains together and adding a munificently large bottom hem.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/082005/curtain3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's my Dad and Uncle Larry installing the curtain... pleat by tedious pleat.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/082005/curtain4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Once the curtain was up, the West speakers were installed and tested by piping in NPR at an insanely loud level. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4080709\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Inskeep's</a> laugh nearly burst my incus!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/082005/curtain5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is another view of the same wall... only backwards.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/082005/curtain6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Meet Papa Bassingway, our 18 inch subwoofer.
