  "body": "Here's a quick look at some of the costumes that debuted at The Moxie this year:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween1.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nDan + handlebar mustache = Morgan Spurlock. Surely you've seen <a href=\"http://tapioca.retroflux.com/?p=144\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">this comparison before</a>.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween2.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nI actually grew to love my new handlebar mustache. I even teared up a little when I shaved it off. On a side note, what's up with the bags under my eyes?! It makes it look like my eyes are bulging. I need some Nads or something.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween3.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis is me as one of the brothers from the band Oasis.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween4.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThe funniest thing about this picture of Nicole is that everything on her is real... except for the 'stache. Doesn't it look like her teeth and nose are fake too? She's going to divorce me for saying that, isn't she?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween5.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThe 'stache was the most popular guy at the party. He was all over the ladies! Here he is getting cozy with Kelley's nose.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween6.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd Justin's obviously in the mood to get freaky!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween7.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd here's the rest of the Moxie staff. J.R. (on the left) is a British rally car racer, and Nate (on the right) is, of course, Shaun from SHAUN OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween8.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAgain with the mustache! Here's my friend Chris looking a bit too much like a certain mass murdering fuckhead (as many important historians have noted).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween9.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd here we have my friend Doug, as the phantom of the opera, singing a number from the play.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween10.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThat's not make-up... his face really looks like that. Halloween is the only day of the year he doesn't have people staring at him.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween11.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere we have a group of Moxie fanatics (Erin, Nicki, and Caleb) dressed as Peter Jackson, raunchy dredlock person, and Donnie Darko.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/110205/halloween12.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd here's the line-up for the best costume competition. From left to right we have: machete boy from DAWN OF THE DEAD, Gene from WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER, Cinderella as a vampire, Wolfman (\"Wolfman's got nards!\"), Shaun from SHAUN OF THE DEAD, Hugh Hefner, Lidia from BEETLE JUICE, Donnie Darko from (duh!) DONNIE DARKO, and Goth Boy. Lidia won the grand prize of a $10 gift certificate to The Moxie... YAY!\r\n\r\nAnd that was The Moxie's Halloween for 2005!",
