Both of the storefronts you see here will belong to The Moxie, and, once everything is finished, will provide a view of our new expanded bar and lobby. The door on the right storefront will be our main entrance (the other door will most likely be locked, or exit only).<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/060808/Untitled-2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This picture was taken just inside the door, looking towards the back of the building. If everything was finished, Steve would be standing in our lobby taking a picture of the entrances to the bathroom. The space is bisected by those giant columns, and our auditoriums will be situated butt-to-butt within the left (East) half of the building.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/060808/Untitled-3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is where the bar will be located. The hole in the wall is the beginning of a door for another business (not The Moxie's), so you can ignore that. The bar will be located under the stair well, and will stick out about 15 feet from the wall. The well-lit area just past the stair well will be part of the lobby.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/060808/Untitled-7.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>As you can see, the trenches have been dug, filled, and are already being covered with concrete. It's amazing how quickly things are moving along. A bit frightening as well.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/060808/Untitled-8.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This cool architectural detail is going to fall between the projection booth and the large auditorium. Apparently someone was brutally murdered here... or so the creepy handprints would have us believe.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/060808/Untitled-4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This picture was snapped from the very back of our space, next to the door that leads out to the parking lot. The area in the far background, so beautifully lit by glorious natural sunlight, will be the lobby.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/060808/Untitled-5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's the door(s) that leads out to the parking lot behind our building. I think the one on the left will be removed and sealed, leaving us with the one on the right. I also like the giant windows back here â€” they remind me of the ones in my elementary school's old gymnasium. AWESOME!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/060808/Untitled-6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>And here's what our door looks like from the parking lot in the back. The \"FOR LEASE\" sign will be replaced with a sweet MOXIE sign in the near future.<br/><br/>And that's it for now. More to come!",
