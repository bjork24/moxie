I can't remember what I'm doing here. I think I'm either trying to walk a straight line, touch my nose, or recite the alphabet. I was totally hammered.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/phlog_4_2.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Of course, I failed the sobriety test, so I decided to pick a fight with the nearest plywood wall.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/phlog_4_3.jpg\" /><br/><br/>The next four shots are basically the same, but my face is in various forms of expression. Feel free to flip through them really fast and insert your own dialogue.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/phlog_4_4.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Take your hands out of your pockets, you fool!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/phlog_4_5.jpg\" /><br/><br/>That's the face I make when I'm thinking about something funny. I was remembering a video from America's Funniest Home Videos where a little kid hit his dad in the crotch with a whiffle ball bat in this picture.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/phlog_4_6.jpg\" /><br/><br/>My skin is slowly starting to blend in with the white paint, which means it's time to start going outside again.",
