The wall that used to divide the back area from what is going to be the auditorium is now gone. Our concession area will begin where the demolition stopped.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/96_pic0tw.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's me giving a tour to Nicole's parents. We're standing in what's going to be a very narrow, anxiety-inducing hallway from the front door to the concession area.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/97_pic2rw.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's some wood.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/98_pic7kk.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's me performing yet another sobriety check before attempting to cross the nail-ridden debris.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/99_pic8go.jpg\" /><br/><br/>The small bathroom has had a wall removed to make it handicap accessible. Once that's complete, we'll have two humongous restrooms.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/100_pic5nu.jpg\" /><br/><br/>Here's a close-up view of where the demolition came to a stop. I think I'm going to have the contractor bring the bottom part of the wall back a little further so we can have a direct view of the side door from the concession area.<br/><br/>Some other points of interest in this picture: the door in the foreground is going to be sealed off and blended in with the wall. The pass-through with the green formica is where we'll sell tickets on busy nights, and the door behind the pass-through will remain as the only access into the concession / box office area.",
