  "body": "Yes, it's true. We've decided to use standard theater seating instead of sofas and chairs. I'll explain in a future post, but for right now, here's what you need to know: these chairs were salvaged from an old theater in Flagstaff, Arizona. I think they hail from the 50s or later. They're fairly small, but in great condition. They're made out of aluminum, and sit quite near to the ground, which is good in a level floor auditorium. The guy we're buying them from has 1,400 of them stored in a warehouse in Springfield. He looks just like Jon Voight and he's awesome, but more on that later. Here's what the chairs will look like:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/88_pic1cb.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nNotice the condition these chairs are in. Everything's 100% original.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/89_pic1lv.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nA lot of them have seat numbers on the front, but they'll peel off with little difficulty.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/90_pic2of.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere's a nice shot of the backside. No dents, no mars, no gum, no nothing! These chairs are SWEET!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/91_pic9jg.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the seat is roughly five inches of nice plush foam. The upholstery is a redish / orangish affair that will look great in our dark auditorium.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/92_pic1tj.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere's an action shot of a typical customer watching a thriller... with a dog.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/93_pic0sx.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere's an action shot of a typical customer watching a comedy... with a dog.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/phlog/94_pic0lt.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nHere's an action shot of a typical customer watching a drama... with a dog.",
