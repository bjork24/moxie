It's Friday and I promised to have a rough draft of our business plan to Andrew today... the only problem is, I'm still not done with the freakin' thing! So I have no other choice but to finish it today at work, which wouldn't usually pose any kind of problem, EXCEPT for the fact that I have beaucoup amounts of \"<i>real</i>\" work to do today too. It's going to be a tough one, but hopefully I'll pull through.<br/><br/>So instead of ranting on about distribution fees and concession goods, I'm going to post some of the results from the marketing survey we did a little over a month ago. We're using these results in our business plan in hopes of bolstering our assertion that Midwestburg is primed and ready for an art-house theater. Just for a moment, pretend you're a bank, take a look at these results, and tell me if you wouldn't fork over $175,000 to Nicole and I on the SPOT.

      "body": "It looks like you put a lot of thought into the survey & the responses look impressive. I have a few questions that a bank or investor would probably ask. Where did you find the respondents for this survey? You mentioned age, but what other demographics describe the survey respondents? If you asked mostly college students, for example, youâ€™re more likely to get good results for your survey. Also, survey respondents tend to be self-selected. If theyâ€™re willing to answer this survey they may already be interested in independent or foreign films. What other documentation, research or articles can you provide to backup your numbers? What competition do you have, direct (other places showing independent or foreign films) or indirect (mainstream movie theaters)? Hopefully this feedback helps a little.",
