  "body": "As of today, Moxie Cinema is a registered theater with Technicolor, the world's number one processor and distributor of motion picture film. If you want to be a theater, you have to have an account with Technicolor or else you can't:\r\n\r\n1. Get films from distributors\r\n2. Receive film in the mail\r\n3. Show film... since you have none\r\n\r\nAs Paul our booking agent put it, \"the Industry has now welcomed you with open arms. Now you just need to build a movie theater.\" True that, Paul. True that.",

Distributors won't talk to you unless you have a Technicolor account, and Technicolor won't talk to you until you book a movie through a distributor. Luckily, Paul knew a nice woman from Wellspring Films (they're the distributors for \"Tarnation\") who booked us a film and pushed our paperwork through. It was a big hurdle to jump, but we DID IT!",
