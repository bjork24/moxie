Also, I just received this e-mail from the Generic Springfield Bank guy (I thought it might be a little post-worthy):<br/><br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/><br/>Good news, the SBA has approved your request.  The loan amount will be $25,000, with the rate of prime plus 2.75% adjusting monthly.  The SBA fee is $425, which has to be paid at closing.  [Generic Springfield] Bankâ€™s fee will be $200, plus some UCC filing fees.  The loan term is for 7 years and all funds must go to purchase equipment.  We will need a list and description (with serial numbers) of all equipment purchased with a value of $500 or more.  You, Nicole, [mom 1] and [mom 2] will all be guaranteeing the note.  The equipment will need to be insured, we have a commercial insurance department that can assist with that if needed.  I will also need copies of all your LLC papers, and business license.  Ann [Omit] at the city will need to send me verification of their loan and that loan needs to close and fund either the same day or before ours and they will need to allow us to be in first lien position on the business assets (that is standard).  At or before close, you will need to furnish proof of your $10,000 cash injection.  I know this sounds like a lot, but it is all standard on these deals.  My colleague, Paulette [Omit], will help coordinate the processing and closing of your loan.  Please get the above information to her or I as it becomes available.<br/><br/>Thanks and congratulations on the start of a new business venture.<br/><br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/><br/>I think Nicole and I might go out and celebrate.",
