Moxie Cinema, Springfield’s premiere independently owned art-house theater opens its doors in early 2005.\r\n\r\nLocated downtown at 408 West Walnut Street, Moxie Cinema’s mission is to create a unique and inviting venue for the exhibition of smaller, lesser-known films that have traditionally been unattainable in the Springfield market. By providing intriguing film series and offering a cinematic experience that differentiates itself from the typical multiplex affair, the Moxie will create a one-of-a-kind service that will benefit the downtown community along with the rest of the metropolitan area.\r\n\r\nAlong with showing films, the Moxie also serves as an art gallery, displaying works from local and regional artists, as well as a wine bar, where patrons can enjoy a glass of beer or wine during their show.\r\n\r\nSpringfield native Dan the Man, along with his wife Nicole, are owners and operators. They have based the Moxie after Ragtag Cinemacafé, an independent theater located in Columbia, MO. “The Moxie will address a long-standing void of smaller, independent films in the Springfield market,” the Man says. “Knowing the type of success these theaters have seen across the nation, and given our own love of movies, it had always been a dream of ours to move back to Springfield and open one downtown.”\r\n\r\nTo help book films that fit the Springfield market, the owners are working closely with founding Ragtag Cinemacafé member Paul Sturtz, along with the newly formed Missouri Film Alliance of Springfield.\r\n\r\n“This is the most exciting development in Springfield’s cultural arts scene in 50 years, when there used to be an arts cinema at the Kickapoo theater on Commercial Street,” says William Brandon Bowman, Director of An Arts Patronage and member of the Missouri Film Alliance of Springfield.\r\n\r\nTentative opening for Moxie Cinema is mid-February, 2005.\r\n\r\n####",
