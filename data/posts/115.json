  "body": "I asked my parents what they wanted for Christmas and their reply was, \"Oh, I don't know. We need sweaters*. You know, like the kind you can wear with jeans.\" \r\n\r\n* Before I continue, I'd like to note that the term \"sweater\" is completely ambiguous within my family. To us, a sweater is any torso-covering garment that is a) long sleeved, b) thicker than a shirt, and c) not a jacket, coat, or wetsuit. For example: Bill Cosby wears heavily patterned sweaters. When you go jogging in the morning, don't forget to throw on a sweater. Do you like my new button-up sweater? I want one of those fleece pull-over sweaters from Old Navy!\r\n\r\nSo, my parents want new sweaters for Christmas. The only problem is, I don't know what kind of sweaters my parents wear these days. My fashion sense is severely limited, especially when shopping for my elders. But as destiny would have it, Nicole and I were at Office Depot last night when I spotted a specialty printing paper that I never knew existed... that's right, I bought a 12 pack of <a href=\"http://www.avery.com/us/Main?action=product.Details&catalogcode=WEB01&node=10211041&productcode=3271\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">ink jet fabric transfers</a>! How sweet is that?\r\n\r\nAfter purchasing the miracle paper, we jogged over to Michael's (craft store, not to be confused with Neverland ranch) and bought two red sweaters. The sweaters aren't really, really dark red (#880000), but they're not too light (#FF9999) either. I'd say they're somewhere in between (#F50E0E). I hope the transfers show up alright. Assuming they do, I'm going to make a big transfer across the front that says:\r\n\r\n<center><b>I HELPED START\r\nTHE MOXIE\r\nAND ALL I GOT\r\nWAS THIS STUPID\r\nSWEATER!</b></center>\r\nIsn't that great? Of course, \"THE MOXIE\" will be replaced with the actual Moxie logo, but everything else will be big block letters (I'm thinking AvantGarde Full or Century Gothic, two of my favorites).\r\n\r\nIf the sweaters turn out okay, I might just ditch the CafePress store and start churning them out by hand. Woo hoo! I wish I knew of a better place to buy good-quality custimizable items. I think Nicole is going to make some aprons and pillow cases for us to use. Uh oh, I probably shouldn't have said that, as we're buying gifts for a few people who happen to read this blog.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I've said too much.",
