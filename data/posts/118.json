I usually give money to something around the holidays, and I thought I'd contribute to the Moxie, having grown up in a place with little o no access to independent cinema...<br/><br/>So, if you ever start taking donations again, I've got money with your name on it.  Okay, so it's not my money so much as the government's, but that's all the more reason to spend it, I say.  I daresay my student loans could be put to no better use.<br/><br/>Best of luck, though!  I enjoy reading about the progress you guys are making.",
