  "body": "Things have cooled down quite a bit around here as of late. I've seen a drastic dip in the Moxie Blog's readership over the last week or so, which I'm attributing to the fact that it's the holidays... I hope. SO, for the last few posts of the year, I'm going to let my hair down (all 1.64 inches of it) and talk about stuff that has nothing to do with the Moxie or any of its affiliates.\r\n\r\nLet's see, what to talk about... what to talk about... ah ha!\r\n\r\nI've been seeing a lot of \"Year In Review\" articles lately, so maybe I'll take a moment to write one of my own. Don't worry, I'm not in the mood to write a novel of a post today, so it won't be THAT bad.\r\n\r\nI should note, I've never been one for \"best of\" lists. If you ask me what my favorite movie is, I won't tell you, because, frankly, I don't know. When it comes to things I like, I tend to mentally glob them together into groups with no particular order (i.e. my 10 favorite movies, my 8 favorite carpet piles, etc.). Not much more to say about that. Let's get crackin'.\r\n\r\n<b>MOVIES I ENJOYED IN 2004</b>\r\n\r\n<i>Nicole and I were very frugal this past year, so we didn't get to see near as many movies as we would've liked. I'm sure this list will be much bigger in 2005.</i>\r\n\r\n<uL><li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/\" target=\"_blank\">Shaun of the Dead</a> - If I had to choose one, I'd say this was probably the best movie that I saw in 2004.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/\" target=\"_blank\">Garden State</a> - Natalie Portman, Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, and Natalie Portman. What's not to like?</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/\" target=\"_blank\">Napoleon Dynamite</a> - What can I say, it grew on me. It's still fairly plotless though.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372183/\" target=\"_blank\">The Bourne Supremacy</a> - I'm a fan of any movie that name-drops a suburb of Springfield.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/\" target=\"_blank\">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a> - I don't care what other people think of him, but I like Jim Carrey and I'm not afraid to admit it.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357/\" target=\"_blank\">Good Bye, Lenin</a>! - Very good movie. Highly recommended, especially if you know German.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Size Me</a> - Speaking of which, I could really go for some McDonald's right about now.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298845/\" target=\"_blank\">In America</a> - If anyone thinks that a game of carnival bean toss can't be suspenseful, they obviously haven't seen this movie.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379557/\" target=\"_blank\">Touching the Void</a> - In my own humble opinion, this is the best recreated documentary-style film about mountain climbing that I've ever seen. Seriously though, excellent film.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298148/\" target=\"_blank\">Shrek 2</a> - Cat-nip. That's not mine! Ha ha ha!</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344510/\" target=\"_blank\">A Very Long Engagement</a> - I haven't actually seen this one yet, but I plan to next week... I've yet to dislike a movie with Audrey Tautou in it.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>MUSIC ALBUMS I ENJOYED IN 2004</b>\r\n\r\n<i>If it weren't for my more musically-inclined friends, I'd only like Bjork, Radiohead, Rufus Wainwright, and the Beatles. Thanks be to <a href=\"http://jglow.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">Justin</a>, Allison, 89.1 FM, and iTunes recommendations for tuning me in and turning me on to many a great album that I otherwise would have never known existed. It should also be noted that while not all of these albums were released in 2004, that's when I first started listening to them, so that's why they're included.</i>\r\n\r\n<uL><li>Bjork - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002JUXB0/\" target=\"_blank\">Medulla</a></li>\r\n<li>Postal Service - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000089CJI\" target=\"_blank\">Give Up</a></li>\r\n<li>Ladytron - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002IQGLW\" target=\"_blank\">604</a></li>\r\n<li>Death Cab for Cutie - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000D1FDI\" target=\"_blank\">Tranatlanticism</a></li>\r\n<li>Benny Benassi - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DIJQU\" target=\"_blank\">Hypnotica</a></li>\r\n<li>Franz Ferdinand - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMWQO\" target=\"_blank\">Franz Ferdinand</a></li>\r\n<li>Emiliana Torrini - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00002DESF\" target=\"_blank\">Love in the Time of Science</a></li>\r\n<li>The Killers - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002858YS\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Fuss</a></li>\r\n<li>Jem - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001FFIY2\" target=\"_blank\">Finally Woken</a></li>\r\n<li>A Girl Called Eddy - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002IQGBC\" target=\"_blank\">A Girl Called Eddy</a></li>\r\n<li>Reed Foehl - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022XEIG\" target=\"_blank\">Spark</a></li></ul>\r\n\r\n<b>TV SHOWS I ENJOYED IN 2004</b>\r\n\r\n<uL><li><a href=\"http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Arrested Development</a> - I've said it before, and I'll say it again, this is probably the best comedy series on network television today.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/amazingrace/\" target=\"_blank\">The Amazing Race</a> - Last season was good, but this season is lining up to be even better.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.fox.com/24/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">24</a> - We Netflixed season 1 and 2 and watched them straight through in 2 weeks.
