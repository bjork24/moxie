I have a little brown box sitting beside me that's filled with all of my coporate belongs: a little green buddha, a ball bearing, a nut, a printer calibration coin from an Eagle envelope machine, a home-made calendar, a caricature of me hitting a computer with an amuzingly large mallet, a giant wad of putty, a picture of Nic and I on our honeymoon, a water bottle filled with pennies, a half dozen pens, etc..<br/><br/>Not much more to say. Onwards and upwards, eh!<br/><br/>I think I've cultivated a nasty patch of ulcers in my belly. Ugh.",
