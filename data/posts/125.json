I refer instead to a real flurry.  Well, not a flurry of snow, like unto the light sprinkling one gets in the winter.  Nay again, I refer to a flurry which means:\r\n\r\n A sudden burst or commotion; a stir: <i>a flurry of interest in the new product; a flurry of activity when the plane landed.</i>\r\n\r\nAnd it sounds pretty good.  You gon' kick the arthouse ass of that other theater.  To quote that dead cajun chef Jeremy _________, \"I guarONtee it.\"  Keep up the good work.  And try not to dwell on the strange fact that this note is longer than the blog entry to which it is attached.  Peace and Happy New Year my friend!",
