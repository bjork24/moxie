  "body": "If you would, please direct your attention to the nice pictures on the left side of your screen. That's the new <b>Moxie Phlog</b>, which is short for Photo Blog. I'm not sure what the real term for a photo blog is, but I'm sure I wouldn't have liked it either way. Thus PHLOG. I have quite a few updates to make, so don't be surprised if I add 2 or 3 new phlogs over the next 2 days.<br/><br/>As for the phlog itself, it's fairly simple to navigate. The side module on the blog page will show the 5 most recent phlogs. You can click on a picture to go directly to that phlog, or you can click where it says \"The Moxie Phlog\" to go to the main phlog page. So sit back, enjoy, and let me know if you notice any bugs.",
