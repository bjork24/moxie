A lot has happened over the last two days - all of which will be dutifully reported in what will most likely be this blog's longest post EVER! In the meantime, here's a question I'd like to bounce off of you:<br/><br/>Considering we get a FIVE head SODA POP fountain, which brands of pop do you think we should serve? Nicole posted this question a few days ago, but I wanted to see what kind of results I'd get from my readership. Here's the ground rules:<br/><br/>1) All of our products will either be in the Coke family or Dr. Pepper.<br/>2) You must use Dr. Pepper for at least one of your choices.<br/>3) You may not question rule number 2 or 3.<br/><br/>So, with that being said, here's your choices:<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Dr. Pepper (regular/diet/vanilla)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Coke (regular/diet/vanilla)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Sprite (regular/diet)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Tea<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Orange pop<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Hawaiian punch<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Lemonade<br/><br/>I think that about does it for now. Stay tuned for a new phlog and a grotesquely large post in the very near future.",

Come on!<br/><br/>Coke<br/>Diet Coke<br/>Dr. Pepper<br/>Sprite<br/>and then..... well, Tea AND Diet Sprite.<br/><br/>Now hear me out on this.  Without Diet Sprite, all of the above options have caffeine and/or sugar.  Some of us would like the option of no caffeine OR sugar.  But if you leave off tea, then you have no options that aren't soda, and some people don't like soda.  So my recommendation is to get six heads.",

Dr. Pepper, and 4.) Sprite.  That leaves one miscellaneous choice, and you should probably target that towards people who don't like soda.  I suspect that either tea or lemonade are the most widely appealing of your non-soda options, and I'd probably choose 5.) Lemonade since fountain tea is frequently so disappointing.<br/><br/>If, for some reason, you were willing to have five sodas, orange pop would be a good fifth choice.  There are a lot of people who love their orange soda.  Maybe a lot of them are kids, though?<br/><br/>(Random aside: I love Dr. Pepper, and I miss living somewhere where that would inevitably be a choice.)",
