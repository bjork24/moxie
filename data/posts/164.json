  "body": "I just wrote a quick and dirty draft of the Moxie marketing letter that I referenced in yesterday's post. I'd like to post it here, so I can get everyone's feedback, but I don't think that would be the wisest move as many of my readers are on the mailing list for said letter. Hmmmm. What to do... what to do? Ok, here's the deal. First, see if you meet these requirements:<br/><br/><ol><li>You do not own a business in downtown Springfield.</li><br/><li>You want to read a short letter about the Moxie and leave at least one constructive comment.</li><br/><li>You have a good eye for contextual editing.</li><br/><li>You pronounce the word STRENGTH as \"s•TRING•th\" and not \"s•TRIN•th\".</li><br/><li>You have a combined annual income of at least $3.48.</li></ol><br/>If you meet these requirements, or at least meet number 1 and 2, please leave a comment on this post that says, \"The sun mainly shines on the plains in Portugal... or, no. Wait a minute. Spain. The sun shines in Spain!\" Don't forget to leave your e-mail address so I can send you an e-mail with the secret URL to the super secret Moxie Marketing Missive. That is all.<br/><br/>This post will self-destruct in 10 seconds.",
