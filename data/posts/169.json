  "body": "First, if you haven't already noticed, there are two new phlogs waiting patiently in the sidebar. Go to them. GO!\r\n\r\n<b>Trivia Slides</b>\r\n\r\nI think it would be fun to pepper the pre-show ads with some Moxie flavored trivia slides. What do you think? Here's the kind of stuff I have in mind:\r\n\r\n<i>Click to enlarge</i>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/0_slide12eh.gif\"><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/1_slide1small7zz.gif\" width=\"425\" border=\"0\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/2_slide26rs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/3_slide2small2ew.jpg\" width=\"425\" border=\"0\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/4_slide43ms.gif\"><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/5_slide4small2ui.gif\" width=\"425\" border=\"0\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/6_slide36lj.jpg\"><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/7_slide3small0pc.jpg\" width=\"425\" border=\"0\"/></a>\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to submit your ideas for Moxie slides, do so in the comments of this post. If it's good enough, and not overly offensive, it might just find it's way into the pre-show rotation.\r\n\r\n<b>T-Shirts</b>\r\n\r\nAs I had mentioned in yesterday's post, it's high time for a Moxie T-Shirt. I'm thinking something along the lines of a small run, limited edition, only-for-blog-readers, totally awesome Moxie shirt! Logo on the front, blog address on the back... the trouble is, we need a catchy saying to accompany the logo. Nicole and I have argued back and forth over what the shirt should say, but we couldn't come to an agreement.\r\n\r\nShe wants: <i>Your mom goes to The Moxie.</i>\r\nI want: <i>I'll Moxie your butthole!</i>\r\n\r\nHer slogan is an allusion to <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i>. Mine is just something I like to say.\r\n\r\nSO, what should the 1st run of Moxie shirts say? Drop your submission into the comments section - along with any Moxie slide ideas - and we'll record them all on a piece of paper and then accidentally lose it somewhere in the backyard. The winning slogan will receive a <b>free Moxie T-Shirt</b> and a <b>printed picture of me packing the winning shirt into a box</b>!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the person who submitted the slogan will receive nothing. Only the slogan is eligible to receive cool prizes. Perhaps you can talk the slogan into sharing the prizes with you... maybe. Maybe not.\r\n\r\nThat's all. Start submitting... NOW!",

I love Allison's screenshot idea of the obscure mountain lion-type photos, as well as the following T-shirt ideas: Nate's \"Y Tu Moxie Tambien\", \"Miracle On Walnut Street\", and LOTR; all of Caleb's suggestions; and Anemone's \"Working...\".  These are all popular indie, cult, or offbeat ideas which would play well to the kind of patrons you want.  Hell, I'm thinking of making my way to Springfield just to get Anemone's shirt.\r\n\r\nAlso, one hugely popular thing that an independent theater did in my college town was this: they determined in the first few months which was their slowest night each week, then regularly showed whatever they wanted on that night.  Sometimes they got 8 or 9 people in there watching something dumb like Major Payne; other times they SOLD OUT for an old Doris Day flick.  As college students, we actually all paid more attention to what the weird movie was that week, and half the time ended up going.\r\n\r\nI've been enjoying the site for a few months now, and I wish you the best of luck!  Hope I haven't taken up too much of your time without meritorious contribution.  :-)",
