I'll post the design in the <a href=\"store.php\" class=\"broken\">Moxie Store</a> sometime this weekend, and I'll order the shirts on Monday. Everyone who sent me an e-mail is guaranteed a shirt, the rest of you will just have to hope they don't sell out.<br/><br/>2. I had a sit-down with Andrew today. As it turns out, the $32K electrical bid was including all the fixtures and installation thereof. Not only that, but the bid was reflecting the cost of the most expensive fixtures, as specified in the plans. I think we can lower the price quite substantially by buying and installing all the fixtures ourselves. I'm also going to talk to our neighbor, who happens to be a master electrician, to see if he can get the job done for a more reasonable fee.<br/><br/>3. That's about it. I'm really tired... I drank two BIG dark beers (beer #1 - Young's Double Chocolate Stout, beer #2 - Guinness) when I met with Andrew at 2:00. That wasn't such a good idea, seeing as I haven't eaten all day. Now... I'm... really... really... tired.<br/><br/>Ugh.",
