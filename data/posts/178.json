Can I get a woot woot***!\r\n\r\n* As opposed to the old one, which is still very DOWN.\r\n\r\n** <i>Is your server running?</i> Yes. <i>Then you better go catch it!</i> Okay.\r\n\r\n*** Please leave your woot woots in the comments. This action, if carried out, will provide me with three bits of information: 1) the comment section and database are still very much intimate with each other, 2) give me an accurate gauge of how many people are accessing the blog and how many aren't, and 3) assure me that the blog didn't lose its entire readership over the weekend.",
