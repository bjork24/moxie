  "body": "Q: What's the difference between drive and delusion?<br/>A: About $10,000<br/><br/>Our bid for HVAC came in... $21,000. To make matters worse, 80% of that cost is tied up in a little piece of equipment called a heat exchanger, thus eliminating any chance of value engineering the bid to a lower price. So, that's a solid $21K that has to come out of the budget.<br/><br/>On the electrical front, our bid is still high. Of the approximate $31K bid, here's how it breaks down:<br/><br/>$11K - Upgrade service, panels, etc.<br/>$9K - Light fixtures (!)<br/>$11K - Labor<br/><br/>The subcontractor based his quote on the electrical plans, which specified that we use ultra-expensive light fixtures. In reality, we should be able to use plane jane light fixtures that cost $10 a pop, as opposed to the $50+ per fixture that was quoted. Also, since the building only had a 200 amp service when we moved in, and it needed to be upgraded anyway, Andrew has agreed to cover the cost of the service upgrade. Thanks Andrew!<br/><br/>Chris, the GC (General Contractor), also gave us a bid for his work - $12,000. That would cover about half of the infill work (framing the walls, sheetrocking, building the projection booth, etc.), with the rest being left for us to finish (painting, building the counter for the concession, laying carpet, etc.). Now, let's look at what we have:<br/><br/>Electrical - $20K ($31K minus the cost of upgrade)<br/>HVAC - $21K<br/>GC - $12K<br/><br/>TOTAL: $53K<br/><br/>Now, factor in how much money we have to use:<br/><br/>Loans - $50K<br/>Infill allowance - $20K<br/><br/>TOTAL $70K<br/><br/>Looking good, eh? Wrong. You forgot about equipment costs.<br/><br/>Projection equipment: $20K<br/><br/>That leaves us with -$3,000 to buy inventory, paint the walls, build the concession area, buy sinks, build a drain, etc.. To cover those additional costs, we're going to need at least another $7K to $10K.<br/><br/>So, as we stand right now, we need to figure out a way to either:<br/><br/>1. Shave $10K to $15K off our expenses, OR<br/>2. Come up with an additional $10K to $15K to cover expenses<br/><br/>I've been on the phone with our equipment dealer for the last two days trying to revise and reduce our equipment costs, but we're already at the bare ass minimum. I might be able to get it down to $16K or $17K, which could save us about $3K... maximum. Then we have to consider the light fixture costs. I think we can get all of our lights for at or below $2K, which would save us another $7K. I'm also meeting with another electrician today to get another bid, which could save us even more money on labor.<br/><br/>So, that's a potential of $10K in savings. Even still, we're just barely under the wire. In the end, $10,000 might not be enough. We have to scrape the bottom of the bucket and then melt the bucket down, turn it into coins, and use those too.<br/><br/>Any suggestions on how we can come up with $10,000 in the next few weeks? Nicole and I have already sold off many of our belongings to cover living expenses, but we still have some big ticket items left... car, TV, kidney, etc..<br/><br/>Where's Brad Pitt when you need him?",

There are a lot of people in Springfield who want to see you succeed. I could imagine some kind of open house even at the theatre (in current condition to add to the charm and desperation.)

A wall of names for the \"Moxie\" where so much would get you a plaque with your name on it. State that plaque would be there for a set time peroid so that if you did not like the way it looked in a year or two you could take them all down and start all over with fresh pain or new fund raiser.
