  "body": "Sorry about the miscommunication yesterday. The auction went live at 12:00 PM eBay time (PST) as opposed to 12:00 PM our time. It's now live and can be viewed <a href=\"http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6524021801\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">right here</a>, or you can just click on the eBay graphic in the sidebar (coming soon). We have an interview set up with the local CBS affiliate for tomorrow. They wanted to run it tonight, but I didn't get back in touch with them in time (damn my hide!). I still have a few more local outlets, mostly radio stations, to send the news tip to.<br/><br/>Thanks again to all of you who have already begun spreading the word! With everyone's help, this could turn out to be quite an exciting adventure... WOOT WOOT!<br/><br/>Also, if you'd like to send a message to the <a href=\"http://www.goldenpalace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Place Casino</a>, you can contact them through their <a href=\"http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&userid=goldenpalacecasino\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">eBay user page</a>! If you're an eBay member, don't forget to WATCH the auction!<br/><br/>PS - If we see a HUGE increase in traffic, there's a very real chance that my server might crash.

Jamie merely asked if Dan would let everyone know how many unique hits he gets on his blog from eBay users after all of this.  <br/><br/>Perhaps you should think about what you say before posting a sarcastic reply to a fellow reader of this blog.  And for the record, one \"theory\" of the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is roughly \"11 meters per second, or 24 miles an hour\".  Of course, with your intelligence level, you could have looked that up on Google yourself or researched the issue instead of asking over-worked Dan to do the legwork.  Good day.",
