  "body": "My posts have really sucked lately. Sorry. There's definitely a correlation between the amount of work being done on the theater and the quality of my posts. For example, look at these two posts:<br/><br/><a href=\"/posts/29\">Example #1</a> - this post was written when we were still living in St. Louis. Not much work was being done on the theater at the time. Back then it was a man, a dream, and a lot of time on my hands at work.<br/><br/><a href=\"/posts/193\">Example #2</a> - this post was written after a long day of working at the theater. I think it speaks for itself.<br/><br/>My one year of leprachuan-granted writing ability is nigh upon us, so I better get a move on! I'll write a witheringly long post tonight... I promise!",
