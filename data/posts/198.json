People were wearing \"summer clothes\"\r\n4. One guy was bleeding\r\n5. No one had presents\r\n6. Everyone looked pissed off\r\n7. There were no holiday decorations\r\n8. I didn't have a beard\r\n\r\nIn fact, now that I think about it, it didn't look or feel much like Christmas at all! I guess the act of emptying out our entire savings to pay for our taxes kind of reminded me of the holidays. Merry Christmas!\r\n\r\nDamn taxes.",
