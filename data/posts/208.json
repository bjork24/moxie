  "body": "As mentioned in last Friday's post, Nicole and I will be at the theater tonight and tomorrow from 5:00 until 7:00. If you'd like to drop by and pick up your shirts, please do. The shirts that aren't picked up at the theater will be shipped on Wednesday, which brings me to my next point: PayPal and incorrect shipping addresses.\r\n\r\nAs Nicole and I were labeling the packages this weekend, I noticed that several of the addresses (provided by PayPal) were wrong. SO, to ensure that you get your shirt, please do one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Show up at the theater and pick it up.\r\n2. Check your PayPal receipt to see if the shipping address is correct.\r\n3. Send me an e-mail (dan [at] moxiecinema [dot] com) with your current mailing address.\r\n\r\nAs for the stickers, I'll mail them out separately once they arrive (hopefully soon). Also, we'll have a few additional shirts and buttons available for sale at the theater tonight and tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<b>Please note</b>, despite the way I act and/or come across on this blog, both Nicole and I are really quite introverted and have been known to mumble and stare at other people's feet while they're talking. I'm just letting you know now so you won't be surprised when it happens... and by \"IT\" I mean \"I lose control of my bladder.\"\r\n\r\n<i>Dan, enough with the shirts! What's going on with the theater?!?!?!</i>\r\n\r\nThree new phlogs aim to answer that question. Check back in an hour...",

And probably the most important question of all, will be Moxie be showing zombie movies?  \r\n\r\nI am all about zombie movies this summer.",

Mumbling?\r\n\r\nI thought you came across as pretty articulate and passionate, though businesslike – as one would expect from somebody trying to get the word out about his venture.\r\n\r\nA fairly good representation of the exchange went something like -\r\n\r\nDan:\tThe equipment.  The equipment is what I want to talk about. (leaning forward; gesturing with hands) We will have what is called a ‘platter system’ in order to show movies by--\r\n\r\nMe:  (Interrupting) Like Shangai Knights!?!\r\n\r\nDan: (Frozen, mid-gesture).\r\n\r\nMe:  Movies like Shangai Knights!  Dude, that movie was so funny.  Owen Wilson is all, like, Whoah, and Jackie Chan was all like Hee-Yah! Hee Yah! (chopping air with hands.)\r\n\r\nDan:  Yes...  We could... possibly... show Shanghai Knights.  Back to the equipment though.  We don’t have a lot of room in our projection booth, so—\r\n\r\nMe:  Oooh.  Have you seen Phonebooth?  I have.  It was okay.  I think Colin Farrell’s way overrated, though.  Hey did you guys see Alexander?!  Wouldn’t it be hot to have Angelina Jolie as your own mom?!?\r\n\r\nDan:  (long, long pause)\r\n\r\nNicole:  (Tugs on ear as secret signal that she wants to leave.)\r\n",
