  "body": "You see, I think the reason(s) I haven't been updating the blog as much is twofold:<br/><br/>1. More work / progress on the theater = less time to blog. A conundrum, to be sure, when your blog is based on the progress / work going on at the theater.<br/><br/>2. I've forgotten where we left off. Seriously.<br/><br/>But now we have a chance to kill two excuses with one post. If you've been reading this blog regularly, I'm sure there are some points that need clarifying. What's the progress on the theater, Dan? Did the HVAC guys ever finish? Start? Those types of questions are what I'm looking for. Yes, I know we've <a href=\"146\">done this before</a>, but it all <a href=\"147\">worked out in the end</a>.<br/><br/>Help me, Old Blog Readers. You're my only hope.<br/><br/>It's 12:12 AM right now. I'll take questions until 10:24 PM tomorrow... er, today. The 18th.<br/><br/><b>UPDATE</b> - there has been a time extension for your questions... mainly because I scored some tickets to the midnight showing of Star Wars! Woo hoo! I'll write the answer post tomorrow. Do you realize this is the first movie Nicole and I have gone to in the theaters since November 2004? That's what opening a movie theater will do to you, folks. That and give you hemroids.",
