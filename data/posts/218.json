  "body": "1. <b>Luke asks four questions:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">When do we get a new phlog that will show us all of the new progress? It sounds like a lot has been done lately. How about a virtual tour?</i>\"<br/><br/>A lot of work has been done since the last phlog, which means I really need to post a new one... several new ones, to be exact. The problem with phlogs is that they take sooooooooooooo long to make. A regular post will take me roughly 10 to 30 minutes to write, depending on the length and the amount of times I have to pause to think of a funny joke. A phlog, on the other hand, typically takes me 7 or 8 hours to complete, depending on whether my \"phlog writing\" suit has been washed or not. Here's a quick preview of a few upcoming phlogs:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/051905/phlog_preview_1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/051905/phlog_preview_2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/051905/phlog_preview_3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>I'll post the FULL versions soon. I promise!<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">A post or two ago you mentioned that 14 feet of wall space does not equal 14 feet of screen. Are you guys running into problems with screen size?</i>\"<br/><br/>It works like this: Our \"picture size\" (the white part of the screen) is going to be 6'6\" x 12'. The screen has a piece of 3\" black webbing that runs along the border, bringing the new size to 7' x 12'6\". The webbing has hooks in it that pull the screen taut along a steel frame, which is roughly 6 inches larger than the screen itself, giving us a total size of 8' x 13'6\". The hooks and webbing will be obstructed from view by permanent masking. Voila! A movie screen!<br/><br/>Do we have a problem with the size? Heck no! Would you have a problem seeing a 12 foot screen in an auditorium that's only 35 foot deep? I think not!<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Have you replaced/fixed your iPod?</i>\"<br/><br/>According to the service status, a replacement iPod has been ordered and is on it's way to... ? I don't know if they send the replacement to California and then on to me, or if they skip the Apple lab and send it directly here. Either way, I needs my precious.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Where's your hat?</i>\"<br/><br/>I bought a brand new, deep red, St. Louis Cardinals hat last week. It's sitting on the piano right now. Don't worry though, I'm sure I'll lose it soon.<br/><br/>2. <b>Nicki J asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Who's your favorite video store girl? And why is she awake at 1:32am when she has to be at work at 9?</i>\"<br/><br/>Bjork. That's the answer to both of your questions.<br/><br/>3. <b>steph v. horn asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">When are you two and Bogey coming up to visit and ride some roller coasters?</i>\"<br/><br/>When the open sores on top of my scalp heal from the last time we came up and rode roller coasters!<br/><br/>4. <b>Evan Erwin asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">The last thing I recall is the contractors came back with a smaller proposal because you needed less electricity. And what about the projector booth? Is it built/operational?</i>\"<br/><br/>Let's see. The HVAC guys are finishing up their work as we speak. I'm hoping they'll be done by tomorrow. As for the electrician... he hasn't even started yet. We have two companies that are bidding on the work. Electrician A's bid is still really high, but he can start next week. Electrician B will be more reasonable, but he won't be able to start for another week or two... at the earliest. It's a tough call, but seeing as we're already strapped for cash, I think the best move will be to wait it out for Electrician B.<br/><br/>The projection booth is completely framed in, but doesn't have a floor yet. I should be picking up ALL the projection equipment on June 1st.<br/><br/>NOTE: Progress will remain slow until the electrician finishes his job. We can't paint / clean / install flooring or drop ceiling until ALL the sheetrock has been put up. Of course, the sheetrock can't be done until the electrician runs all the new wiring. It's like a vicious cycle... only it's focused on one person / sub-contractor.<br/><br/>5. <b>Sam Spade asks four questions:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">The Moxie window coverings?</i>\"<br/><br/>... need to be ordered. I'm still not sure what design, if any, we're going to use. I don't want it to look dated in a year or two. Hmmm. This question hurts my head.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Proof of your Scene It? championship status. A photo of the title belt will do.</i>\"<br/><br/>Proof? How about this: the last time I played Scene It (with Nicole, DUG, and DUG's girlfriend), I was politely asked to sit out after the first round. Apparently, it was no fun to play with someone who knew ALL the answers. *sigh* It hurts to be this good.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Did we learn to play nice with with subcons, GC, bank, and various other authority figures?</i>\"<br/><br/>I always play nice... especially when I have plenty of time and money on my hands.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Who (or what) chewed you out to spawn the etymological discussion on the phrase?</i>\"<br/><br/>No one chewed me out... yet. But I'm sure it's just a matter of time until SOMEONE does. For what, I don't know.<br/><br/>6. <b>nicholas asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">How are relations with distributors? Are they wondering when you'll open/ready to get movies to you? Is all of that lined out?</i>\"<br/><br/>Distributor relations are good. <a href=\"http://www.ragtagfilm.com\" target=\"_blank\">Paul</a> and Nicole are currently building a tentative schedule for our first month of showings. <a href=\"http://www.filmmovement.com\" target=\"_blank\">Film Movement</a>, which you referred us to, gave me a call a few weeks ago to check on our progress... more out of sincere curiosity rather than a \"hurry up and start booking our films!!!\" mentality. They're good eggs. In fact, the NYC distributors seem to be collectively much more laid back and COOL than their LA brethren. There needs to be a gang war between the two factions.<br/><br/>7. <b>Caleb asks SIX questions:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Why don't you ever rent movies when I am working?</i>\"<br/><br/>Because you don't work at Paradise Adult Superstore, do you?<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Did the guy in the RV ever leave?</i>\"<br/><br/>Yep. He also left behind a couple nice RV kick-stand craters in the parking lot whence he was park'd. Still, I'd take the craters over the RV any day!<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Who is your favorite movie critic? Or do you hate them all?</i>\"<br/><br/>Kenneth Turan and Roger Ebert are usually right on the money 80% of the time. Also, when he's not fixating on bad science fiction movies, Stephen King can be rather astute in his movie critiquing abilities. I could care less about the rest of them.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">What IS the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?</i>\"<br/><br/>24 mph.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Whatever happened to predictability?</i>\"<br/><br/>She moved to Philadelphia and is now in charge of programming the giant sign on top of the PECO building.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Are you still planning on having a \"preview\" night for blog readers when you open? And if so, any idea what movie you might be showing? A new one or classic?</i>\"<br/><br/>Yes, we're still planning on it, but I don't know what we'll be showing. It's a surprise!<br/><br/>8. <b>whitty asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">I am worried about Benzo. Once you go all Darth, can you go back? I mean, without being killed by your son, deathbed confessions and becoming a luminous smiling ghost and all. Also, I hope you and Nicole are getting enough downtime, you guys sound stressed and busy.</i>\"<br/><br/>Just as Vader eventually destroyed the last of the Sith lords, so will Benzo return to the Jedi way. As for Nicole and I having downtime... we watched Star Wars last night. That was the first movie we'd seen together, by ourselves, since November 2004. We also hold hands... sometimes. I won't elaborate anymore on our \"downtime.\" Grrrrr.<br/><br/>9. <b>DUG asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Just go ahead and tell your favorite big blue dido story. You know you want to!</i>\"<br/><br/>One time I met Dido and she was big and blue. It was great.<br/><br/>10. <b>Nicole asks two questions:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Will Jack Bauer save America?</i>\"<br/><br/>Yes, but Tony will die.<br/><br/>\"<i style=\"color: #B00\">When do I get to stop working temp jobs?</i>\"<br/><br/>When the open sores on top of my scalp heal from the last time we visited Stephanie and Joel and rode roller coasters!<br/><br/>11. <b>Dave asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">In the moxie bathrooms... will the stalls go all the way down to the floor?</i>\"<br/><br/>No, but they will go all the way to the ceiling.<br/><br/>12. <b>Allison asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">How is advertising and collaborating with the neighbors going? Any exciting ideas come up... like little Moxie Quiches?</i>\"<br/><br/>It's going good. We've been doing a lot of networking as of late, and just became members of the DSA (Downtown Springfield Association). I've had to put a lot of our marketing efforts on hold while I deal with construction issues, but Nicole should be taking up the slack shortly.<br/><br/>13. <b>Nicole asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Did DUG actually mean dildo or dido? And, what did you think of Star Wars?</i>\"<br/><br/>DUG meant dildo, but he doesn't have an \"L\" key on his keyboard. As for Star Wars, I LOVED IT! I could've watched close-ups of Natalie Portman for hours!<br/><br/>14. <b>Maddy asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">What was the final decision in the Custard/Yogurt war? And the coffee is coming from? The beer? You know, your choice of beverages and food will play a large role in my attendance.</i>\"<br/><br/>We decided on Andy's Frozen Custard, but now we have to figure out a way to store it in our teeny tiny Cinebar! The coffee AND tea is coming from the Muddhouse. All the beers will be from Missouri - Boulevard (Kansas City), Schlafly and Budweiser (St. Louis), Springfield Brewing Company (Springfield... duh!), and possibly a small microbrew called \"Little Yeoman's\" out of Mountain Grove, Missouri. The food will be catered in from Sweet Suzy's Bakery (next to Harpo's and the Mudd Lounge).<br/><br/>15. <b>Nate requests:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo.</i>\"<br/><br/>This is wonderful news.<br/><br/>16. <b>Tawny asks:</b> \"<i style=\"color: #B00\">Will your patrons get to request movies? Will you do a customer appreciation evening and show the movie with the most requests? If so, may we start requesting now?</i>\"<br/><br/>That's a great idea! I'm sure we'll do something similar (possibly with the late night movies on the weekends), but our main goal is to get the place open. Priorities: open theater, drink Dr. Pepper, take requests from the general public.<br/><br/>ALSO: There's a rumor floating around Springfield that we've run out of money and abandoned the project. If you hear someone say this, please kick them in the balls and/or the soft area behind their knee and set the story straight.",
