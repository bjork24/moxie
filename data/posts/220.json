  "body": "One year. 365 days. 8,760 hours. 525,600 minutes. 31,536,000 seconds. That's a lot of time, my friends. You'd think I would've been able to churn out a few more than 217 posts in a year... but you're wrong. And besides, it's quality, not quantity that matters to me. In fact, in what may be the most amazing coincidence in the last 14 years, this post also marks the typing of my 100,000th word on this blog. That's a lot of words, my friends. I wonder which word will be the BIG 100K? It could be any one of these words... the pressure is killing me!!!\r\n\r\nLet's look at it this way - here's a breakdown of literature classes based on word count:\r\n\r\n• Micro-Fiction = up to 100 words\r\n• Flash Fiction = 100 - 1,000 words\r\n• Short Story = 1,000 - 7,500 words\r\n• Novellette = 7,500 - 20,000 words\r\n• Novella = 20,000 - 50,000 words\r\n• Novel = 50,000 - 110,000 words\r\n• Epics and Sequels - Over 110,000 words\r\n\r\nSo, if I printed out every post on this blog, along with all of your comments, we'd have an EPIC on our hands. An incredible story of a husband and wife team who --\r\n\r\nWEENUS\r\n\r\nSorry, I wanted to make sure that the 100,000th word was a good one. I'm not sure if that was it, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nBUNGO\r\n\r\nOk, so where was I? Right... this blog is an Epic. You know, I briefly considered doing an interview betwixt myself and 2004 Dan, but I decided not to since 2004 Dan isn't different enough from 2005 Dan (i.e. me) to make it funny. With that being said, I want everyone to know that I could totally take 2004 Dan if I had to. Think about it. I bet 2004 Dan can't even remember the last time he picked up a hammer. What a wuss.\r\n\r\nHere are 10 things I had in May of 2004 that I don't have in May of 2005.\r\n\r\n1. Cable TV\r\n2. Regular paychecks\r\n3. Good health and dental insurance\r\n4. Lots of free time\r\n5. A couch\r\n6. A savings account... with money in it\r\n7. Vacation time\r\n8. The ability to eat at Taco Bell every day\r\n9. A psychotic neighbor\r\n10. A job I hated\r\n\r\nNow, let's switch sides and see what I have in 2005 that I didn't in 2004\r\n\r\n1. 100x the stress\r\n2. A piano\r\n3. Walking distance to a porn store\r\n4. Hemroids... a little one\r\n5. Cool Moxie shirt, buttons, and sticker\r\n6. A backyard\r\n7. An 18\" core of solid concrete\r\n8. A theater that is 65% finished\r\n9. A savings account... with no money in it\r\n10. A job I like (eventually)\r\n\r\nWee! Wasn't that fun?! And now it's time for a song:\r\n\r\n<i>[SPOKEN]\r\nC’mon baby where you going?\r\nCos ya know I want it...\r\nI don’t wanna blog ya to get ya\r\nBecause I want it\r\nCutie just slip into your Firefox-ay\r\nAnd let big Dan blog ya all day\r\nCos the first time I saw ya\r\nI wanted to kick it to ya\r\nYour blog is slammin’\r\nSo honey can I bookmark ya\r\nCos you and I both know tricks are for kids\r\nSo get the Don Perignon outta the fridge\r\nI wanna do the first thing that comes to mind\r\nCos on a scale of one to ten\r\nNo question you're a dime\r\nI’m attracted to ya cos you blogrolled me\r\nAnd sweetheart, Color Me Badd\r\nIs gonna blog you up\r\n\r\nHey, beautiful lady, I need you tonight\r\nLovely, lovely lady\r\nI wanna make you feel all right, yeah\r\nI can’t deny, baby\r\nI wanna blog you down\r\nYou are so fine, baby\r\nAll I wanna do is\r\n\r\n(I wanna blog you up)\r\nI want to blog you up\r\nAll night (girl you make me feel good)\r\nI want to (let me type you down) blog you up.\r\n\r\nSay do you feel lonely girl\r\nLet me turn down the lights\r\nSo I can blog you in the darkness\r\nOoh baby, let’s read Dan's blog tonight\r\nYeah, dig, you read so right baby\r\nWhen I blog you down\r\nPlease link me, sugar\r\nCause all I wanna do is\r\n\r\n(I wanna blog you up)\r\nI want to blog you up\r\nAll night (girl you make me feel good)\r\nI want to (let me type you down) blog you up.\r\n\r\nGirl you just make me feel so good\r\nI just wanna...

When is it coming on the radio? \r\n\r\nYou should contact Darcy Stevens at the SMSU Music Department (dws695t@smsu.edu) to get you a little Chopin ditty to play on the radio about the Moxie. He teaches MUS 216 and 316 which are all about electronic music recording and the whole point of the class is to make a jingle for a local business...though usually no one wants them cause they'd rather pay more to get more cheese for their commercials. I bet a group in the MUS 216 class next semester would make a jingle for you and wouldn't charge you much for it. Just an idea if you have enough money in the fall for radio marketing. \r\n\r\nHappy birthday Moxie blog!",
