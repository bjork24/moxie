  "body": "... it will be because I've inhaled unhealthy amounts of the following substances over the last 25 years of my life:<br/><br/>1. Black mold<br/>2. Sawdust<br/>3. Oven cleaner fumes<br/>4. Helium<br/>5. Cigarette smoke<br/>6. Wood screws<br/>7. <a href=\"http://www.backyardnature.net/pix/cockrch2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese wood cockroaches</a><br/>8. Calvin Klein's Escape for men<br/>9. That sugary dust that collects at the bottom of cereal bags<br/>10. Dr. Pepper<br/><br/>Needless to say, my throat hurts all the time and I have lymph nodes the size of hackey sacks.<br/><br/>I'm watching Bogey chase squirrels across our backyard. The expression on his face is much like mine if I were to see a couple well-done steaks scurrying through the branches. <i>Why are there steaks up in that tree? I don't know, but if one of them drops... I'm eating it!</i><br/><br/>Isn't it sad that there's all kinds of work going on at the theater right now, and this is the kind of post I write? Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes you don't.<br/><br/>I'm off to go cuddle with the projector.",
