If you're one of the lucky people who have a Moxie shirt, and you'd like to show off where it's been, send us a picture at info [at] moxiecinema.com.

Thanks Adam and Jaime!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/ben01.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Ben with MU statue #1</i>, <b>Columbia, MO</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.bendillon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Ben</a>)<br/><br/>It's the University of Missouri! Our old stomping ground!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/ben02.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Ben with MU statue #2</i>, <b>Columbia, MO</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.bendillon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Ben</a>)<br/><br/>It's Beetle Bailey... and he doesn't have a mouth!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/ben03.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Ben with MU statue #3</i>, <b>Columbia, MO</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.bendillon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Ben</a>)<br/><br/>Few people know this, but Thomas Jefferson actually wrote the Declaration of Independence while gazing at the columns at MU.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/ben04.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Ben vs. Column: the beginning</i>, <b>Columbia, MO</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.bendillon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Ben</a>)<br/><br/>Anyone who's ever gone to MU has a picture like this. Thanks Ben!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/061605/beach.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Child attacks passerby</i>, <b>Los Angeles, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>The funny thing about Jed's photos is that he's never in them... just the shirt... looking cool as hell... draped over a confused stray animal of some kind.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/jed01.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>John Wooden Center</i>, <b>UCLA campus, Los Angeles, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>Hey look! It's the John Wooden Center! I don't know what else to say.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/jed02.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Shirt begging to be sat on</i>, <b>Newport Beach, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>Judging by the wrinkles on the shirt, it must've had a fun night!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/jed03_a.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Happy smoker with shirt #1</i>, <b>Los Angeles, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>I'm sure Jed knows the person holding the shirt in this picture, but I like to pretend he just asked someone walking down the street. The dude holding the shirt becomes more and more enthused as the camera moves closer. Classic!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/jed03_b.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Happy smoker with shirt #2</i>, <b>Los Angeles, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>In case you're wondering, that's the famous Fox Theater in the background... yet another reason for the shirt holder to be so enthusiastic.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/jed03_c.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Happy smoker with shirt #3</i>, <b>Los Angeles, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>The guy in green in envious of the shirt holder's enthusiasm.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071005/jed03_d.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Happy smoker with shirt #4</i>, <b>Los Angeles, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>It doesn't get any better than that. Thanks Jed!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071505/lunalovesmoxie2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Luna loves Moxie</i>, <b>Chicago, IL</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/~chairry/\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel</a>)<br/><br/>Luna looks as enthused to be holding the Moxie shirt as the guy in the last picture! She clawed you after taking this picture, didn't she. Cute cat. Cute shirt. Thanks Rachel!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/072105/jed1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Jed at the Del #1</i>, <b>San Diego, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>Look! It's Jed's first Moxie shirt adventure photo with him actually wearing the shirt.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/072105/jed2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>Jed at the Del #2</i>, <b>San Diego, CA</b> (via <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/abovedarim21/jed.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Jed</a>)<br/><br/>Here's Jed pretending to put his hand on the Hotel Del Coronado sign. I bet there were armed gaurds aiming high-powered rifles at Jed... just waiting for him to accidentally touch the sign. \"<i>Ok, he just touched it. Take him down, boys!</i>\"<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/072105/mark1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>The Moxie in the City of Lights</i>, <b>Paris, France</b> (via <a href=\"http://marksmumblings.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark</a>)<br/><br/>This is by far the furthest flung photo of a Moxie shirt in action. According to Mark, he's standing on top of the Arc du Triumph in the heart of Paris AND there's a cute girl off to his right. I'm not sure what that big pointy thing is in the background... maybe a cell phone tower or something.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/072905/moxiebusch.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>The Moxie and the Cards</i>, <b>St. Louis, Missouri</b> (via Nathan)<br/><br/>I'm really jealous. Not only did Nathan get to see a game in the Cardinals last season in Busch Stadium, but he also got to wear his super cool Moxie shirt. Damn.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/112506/jed.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><i>The Moxie and the Cards</i>, <b>Los Angeles, California</b> (via Jed)<br/><br/>Another Moxie shirt appears at ANOTHER Cards game, this time versus the crappy Dodgers. Jed only owns one shirt... and that's this one.",

It's a single screen auditoriun that fits roughly 550 people. The Moxie will soon have the luxury of hosting a premeire similar to those with the help of my lil black book....and lots of death threats. <br/><br/>P.S. there are more to come.   ",
