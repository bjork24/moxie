  "title": "Day 3: Clean as a whistle",
  "body": "I can summarize today's events with one word: cleaning-and-building-with-lunch-at-Taco-Bell.\r\n\r\nFrom 10:00 am until 5:30 pm, Nicole and I did nothing but clean, then my dad showed up and the cleaning turned into building, which lasted until 8:00 pm. It was a very long and productive day. Here's a quick rundown of what was done:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>I sanded the speakerboxx for the third and final time.</li>\r\n<li>Nicole cleaned one of the bathrooms.</li>\r\n<li>I mudded the west wall for the third and final time.</li>\r\n<li>Nicole swept the entire theater, removing massive amounts of sheetrock dust.</li>\r\n<li>I dumped all kinds of trash into the dumpster across the street.</li>\r\n<li>I fixed the popper (it was scraping on one side of the kettle, so I used pieces of scrap aluminum to increase the space between the heating element and the kernal mover).</li>\r\n<li>I moved all the lumber into the main auditorium.</li>\r\n<li>I reswept what Nicole swept.</li>\r\n<li>Nicole reswept what I reswept.</li>\r\n<li>Dad and I put up the final board along the west wall.</li>\r\n<li>Dad and I built the floor for the little stage at the front of the auditorium.</li></ul>\r\nIt may not seem like much when you read it, but you don't understand how much cleaning we did. I mean, there was just soooooooo much sheetrock dust... I broke down and cried at one point. It was a very sad, and sharp, point. Got me right in the eye.\r\n\r\nFor lunch, I had one of those new Taco Bell wraps... you know, the ones that are \"good to go.\" It was alright. I think the best thing about it is that they use a tostada shell, which means it's only a matter of time until my all-time favorite Taco Bell dish makes its way back onto the menu... TOSTADAS!!! But enough about me, here's some pictures from the last two days:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/fridge1_a.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis is the gigantic 17 cubic foot all-fridge that we bought at Sears yesterday. This is the second one we've purchased. One will stay in the prep area, while the other will reside closer to the Cinebar. Both will be stocked with enough beer to kill me thrice.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/fridge1_b.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThere are two features I insisted our refrigerator have before I would consider buying it: 1) wire shelves (more customizable) and 2) simple design (no fancy half-shelves, or can slides, or egg holders). The interior of this refrigerator is the epitome of simplistic elegance. I love this appliance. It is absolutely stunning, isn't it?! Who needs a freezer anyway! Like you were ever going to eat those frozen waffles...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/fridge2_a.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThis is our little fridge, the one that will be IN the Cinebar. For convenience, the most popular drinks will be stored in this little beauty. We'll restock it from one of the big fridges between rushes. The stainless steel model to the left, which was identical in every way to our fridge, was $115 more. Stupid steel. Stupid stains. My god, I want that refrigerator SO BAD!!!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/fridge2_b.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's the inside. Not quite as elegant as the all-fridge, but it'll do. Nothing says classy like pulling a customer's beer out of the crisper!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/fridge2_c.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's Nicole demonstrating how short the refrigerator is. For those of you who don't know, Nicole is a dwarf. That's a mini-fridge she's standing next to.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/wall.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nWest wall + faux wainscoting + wood = a much tidier wall. Check out the duct tape letter \"R\" on the back of the window covering. Have you ever seen such a beautiful \"R?\" I think not. That's a duct tape coconut tree to the left of the \"R.\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/cleaning1.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's Nicole sweeping up shitrock dust.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/cleaning2.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAw! How sweet! Nicole drew this with the end of her broom handle... while she should've been sweeping... so I taught her a lesson she won't soon forget... how to throw a curve ball. Look at all that DUST!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/stage1.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nCheck out how clean the auditorium is now! The material you see here will soon become the stage. And look! It's my Mom!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/stage2.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nHere's Dad drilling the baseboard into the terrazzo. We decided to go with treated lumber so the wood wouldn't rot when someone inevitably spills their drink and it oozes down the auditorium floor and pools up at the base of the stage. Nice thinking.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071305/stage3.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAnd this is pretty much where we left off this evening, with the stage floor built and secured to the wall.\r\n\r\nMore fun stuff tomorrow! *pause* Man, I'm mondo mega tired. I'm going to go read some \"Freakanomics\" and hit the hay. Adios!",

It's not like she doesn't have enough self-esteem when she towers over the dorm fridges.\r\n\r\nOn a completely different tack (ouch!), what's your father's take on this whole theater idea? We get regular reports from you and Nicole, but your dad is like Chief from \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.\" Minus the water fountain tossing, of course. \r\n\r\nIs he just a silent drone with a vast knowledge of carpentry? Is he a product of Disney animatronics? Is he, in fact, Benzo?",
