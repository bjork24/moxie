  "body": "The inside of the auditorium has been painted! Not completely, but enough so that when most people see it they'll be duly impressed. Or at least they should be. Thanks be to <a href=\"http://www.sweetwaterabilene.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">J.R.</a> for helping us finish in a quick, yet evenly paced manner. <a href=\"http://justin.commonelectric.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Justin</a> and Kelley (yes, that's really their names) will be helping us do even more painting tomorrow. Hooray! Here's some nice pictures of today's visible progress:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/upload1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Here's J.R. applying the first coat of ultra-expensive, super-thick, terrible-tasting Kilz Premium primer to the nasty West wall.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/upload2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>This is what the screen wall looked like when I was 85% of the way done. Quite a descriptive caption, eh?<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/upload3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>J.R. and Nicole begin applying the purple / gray / taupe paint to the back wall of the auditorium.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/upload4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Is that the same ugly West wall? Why yes. Yes it is. Amazing!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/upload5.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The auditorium is nearly complete!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/upload6.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The purple / gray / taupe color goes quite well with the black... even more so when we don't have to look at it under crappy fluorescent lights.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/poster_big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071905/poster_small.jpg\" width=\"425\" /></a><br/><br/>And for those of you who were curious about our poster collage, this is what we're aiming for. Click on the picture above to enlarge the collage. As you can see, we're using details from much larger posters. I really like the way it looks... in PhotoShop. I hope we can replicate it in the really real world. Nicole wanted me to point out that this isn't the final placement of the posters, and I concur. I want the <i>Jaws</i> poster to be directly below the <i>Garden State</i> one.<br/><br/><b>Other big news</b><br/><br/>Nicole and I met with Mark Biggs today, the head of the Electronic Arts department at MSU, to discuss future collaborations. We have a lot of cool ideas, such as: screening student short films before regular movies, creating an advanced film class and business class to be taught at the theater (by none other than myself and Nicole), hosting MSU-sponsored alumni presentations, etc., etc., etc.. It was a nice meeting. Mark's a really nice guy... smart as a whip too. I look forward to working with him in the near future.<br/><br/>Let's see... what else happened? Oh yeah! How could I forget! We met with Bucky Bowman, the director of the Springfield Arts Patronage, to discuss our current \"broke as a joke\" problem. Nicole and I had been batting around the idea of doing an \"adopt a chair\" fundraiser, but Bucky wanted us to take it a bit further. Here's what we're going to do:<br/><br/>Become a Moxie Founding Member Today! By becoming a founding member, you will be treated to a year's worth of free movies. Whenever you want to see a movie within our first year of operation, simply stop by and flash your Moxie Founding Member card... the movie's on us. After the first year, you'll receive $2.00 off regular ticket prices and a free movie ticket on your birthday. Need some popcorn? That's free too! What's that? You want more? How about one free pre-show ad per year that will run on the day of your choice... AND your name on one of the Moxie's seats... AND your name on the Founding Members plaque... AND an invitation to the Founding Member party the night before our grand opening. Can it get any better? Sound too good to be true? Well, it isn't. It's real, and Moxie Founding Memberships will be going on sale soon.<br/><br/>Now, how much would you expect to pay for a membership like that? $10,000? $5,000? $1,000? For a limited time only, all Founding Memberships are going for the low, low price of just $_______! Can you believe that?! How can we even make a profit? Remember, we only have a limited amount of these memberships, so it's first come, first served.<br/><br/>*END INFOMERCIAL*<br/><br/>Seriously, that's what we're going to do. We have 70 seats, which means we can have 70 founding members. Members will receive free movies for our first year of operation (one per day), and $2.00 off standard admission each year afterwards. They'll also receive free popcorn, one free ad per year, their name on a chair and plaque, and a swanky pre-opening party thrown in their honor. Does that sound appealing to anyone out there? Seriously, if we were to sell a membership with all those perks for $500, how many of you would buy one?<br/><br/>Think about it this way: if you were to go to the theater three times a month ($8 per ticket), and buy a popcorn and drink each time ($6 per visit) you'd be spending $504 over the course of a year. The membership has already paid for itself! So, what do you guys think?",

I thought you were already cutting it fairly close to the quick as far as leaving enough revenue for operating expenses.  Did ANY of those membership levels offer unlimited FREE movies for a YEAR?  And they sure cost a lot more than $500 if they did.<br/>You know the business model better than I do, Dan, (of course) but I'm just curious how this can work now.",

      "body": "I'm not sure this is a good idea.  Is it worth getting the money up front even though you'll be missing out on revenue from the most loyal part of your customer base for a whole year? <br/><br/>This sort of thing works in general because (like gift certficates) most people won't use the entire value and you get to keep the extra.  Plus, they will bring their friends with them, who will pay full price. However, 500 is a hefty sum to pay and then not show up, and I would imagine that your buyers are going to be the same people who would have come several times a month anyway...now you just don't make money when they do. <br/><br/>You could sell more than 70 if you don't do the plaques (an added expense anyway) because they won't all show up for the same show.  I doubt you can sell more than 70 but whatever. Maybe just do one plaque in the lobby or something...<br/><br/>One more negative thought--what do you do if you go out of business?  Presumably that would only happen if you have a cash flow problem so severe that you can't recover.  Most small businesses succumb to this very problem.  I would sure as heck want my money back and you wouldn't have it available to give me, would you?  <br/><br/>I would sell a yearly membership with discounts or have a frequent movie-goer program before I would do this.  It might solve your more immediate problem regarding capital, but I think it might really hurt your cash flow in the long run. ",
