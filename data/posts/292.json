  "body": "The Moxie will be opening its doors to the public on September 21st, 2008... just kidding! 2006. No? Not good enough for you? Fine. We'll open on September 21st, 2005. Geesh. We sent out a flurry of press releases today, announcing our grand opening, so don't be surprised if you see a rash of Moxie-related stories cropping up in your favorite Springfield-based tabloid.\r\n\r\nAs for the theater itself, the bathrooms are finished; the Cinebar is in the final throes of finishment (not a word), and the terrazzo floors STILL aren't finished (more on that later). We've had a few setbacks with our film schedule, but all in all we're very pleased with the line-up we have for late September / October. We will be printing and distributing a monthly calendar with all of our movies, so keep your eye out for those in mid-September.\r\n\r\nWe'll also be doing a few days of invitational \"test screenings\" before the grand opening, wherein a certain amount of lucky Moxie supporters will be invited to the theater for a free showing. I have every intention of setting up one (maybe two showings) for blog readers... after all, you guys have been our biggest supporters... but I need to see a show of hands for those that would like to attend. I'll most likely set up an online RSVP system, but I need to determine whether we'll need one or two showings to fit in all my weirdo blog readers. If this sounds like something you'd like to do, give me a YAY in the comments.\r\n\r\nPS - Founding Members needn't give a yay, as you already have your own party in the works.",
