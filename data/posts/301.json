For those of you who came last night: thanks! And for those coming tonight: early thanks! I'll post pictures sometime over the weekend (most likely Sunday), but until then please feel free to unburden yourself on <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/forum/index.php?action=vthread&forum=1&topic=27\" class=\"broken\">this timely topic from the Moxie forum</a>.\r\n\r\nWish us luck!",
