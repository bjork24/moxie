  "body": "Before I begin this series, let me begin by prefacing it with this: The Moxie is a business run by a guy (and his wife) who happens to write a blog that is read by millions and millions of people looking for a good laugh. Be warned, if you visit our theater and say or do something that most people would deem \"stupid,\" you may get written about on the blog.<br/><br/>The majority of our customers don't have to worry about being written about, but for those of you who do... fear not. Your identity will be masked behind the veil of a generic moniker, such as \"guy 1\" or \"girl A,\" or maybe even \"Mr. Stinky Stinkerton.\" So, without further ado, let me recount verbatim (or as close to it as I can get) a conversation I had with two customers earlier today.<br/><br/><b>GUY 1:</b> Does this \"Murderball\" have obscenities in it?<br/><b>DAN:</b> Cussing?<br/><b>GUY 1:</b> Yes. Curse words, sex, nudity... that kind of garbage.<br/><b>DAN:</b> Well, there is cussing. And the rugby players do discuss their sex lives, in light of their condition, in a humorous manner, but nothing that I'd consider offensive.<br/><b>GUY 1:</b> Hmm.<br/><b>GUY 2:</b> You know. I don't have a problem watching an R-rated film, or even an X-rated one, as long as it doesn't have any cussing or nudity or fighting.<br/><b>DAN:</b> Well, unfortunately, we don't show X-rated movies here.<br/><b>GUY 2:</b> Really? Hmm.<br/><b>GUY 1:</b> Hmm.<br/><b>DAN:</b> I hope to see you both at \"Murderball\" tomorrow!<br/><br/>And scene. Uh oh, time for a reel change!",

(slightly related) that reminds me.. its always gross hearing girls giggle and scream over things like Mel Gibson's ass in a movie...  thus the reasons girls *shouldnt* watch such thing.. even if they do",
