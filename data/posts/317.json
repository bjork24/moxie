  "body": "Nicole and I are starving, but we can't decide what to eat for dinner. I'm in the mood for a roast-beefy-warmish-to-hotish-type dish (with or without bread), and Nicole just wants anything that's edible. Hell, she'll even go for SEMI-edible at this point. Ok, we just ordered Jimmy John's... not because I'm a big fan of Jimmy John's, but it's close (although we're still having them deliver) and they have roast beef sandwiches, which I can heat up in our quarter-power microwave. I've yet to freak from their fastness... although I'm about to frunk* from my fasting.<br/><br/><b>FRâ€¢UNK</b> <i>v.</i> (phrunk) - To die from exceedingly severe hunger pains or a lack of proper roast-beefy-warmish-to-hotish-type dishes.<br/><br/>My growing hunger has made me delirious, so I'm now going to write something that I always promised myself I wouldn't... a list of restaurants that would strive and profit in Springfield, MO (especially downtown) due in large part to my sole patronage. If I had all the money in the world, and knew ANYTHING about running a restaurant, I would start ALL of these eateries. However, since I don't have the funds (yet), I'm going to share my ideas with the world in hopes that someone with enough loose change will take one of these ideas and make it into a reality.<br/><br/><b>Cheap Chinese food downtown (with delivery)</b> - I'm amazed that I even have to mention this one, given Springfield's borderline-perverted love of Chinese food. Being a native Springfieldian, I salivate at the thought of having $3.99 Cashew Chicken delivered to The Moxie. Some may say, \"but what about The Ricksha or Korea House?\" And to you I say, \"I want delivery!\" Catering to laziness is the cornerstone of success.<br/><br/><b>Two words: Stir Crazy</b> - (1) Go to St. Louis, (2) go to Stir Crazy, (3) fall in love. For a town as much in love with Chinese food as Springfield, there is practically NO VALID REASON why we shouldn't have a Stir Crazy. In fact, one would go really well where Traffic is (used to be). I can honestly say that Stir Crazy is my favorite restaurant in the entire world. Better than the French Laundry, better than Emeril's, better than Wolfgang Puck's, better than PIZZA HUT!<br/><br/><b>Hello? Macaroni Grill calling!</b> - Why should Zio's own the Italian restaurant market in South Springfield. They literally have zero competition for good, mid-range, family-friendly Italian cuisine. And EVERYONE goes there! Have you ever been to Zio's when it wasn't packed? A Macaroni Grill would level the playing field, and add variety to the Italian palette. If you haven't eaten there before, drive up to Kansas City, St. Louis, or Columbia (yes, even they have one) and experience Focaccia bread that will make you spilch in your pants.<br/><br/><b>Lion's Choice, for the love of...!</b> - Ok, <strike>Popeye's Chicken</strike> Bojangles just went out of business on Battlefield (they were open for what? One month? Two months tops?), which leaves a perfect location for a Lion's Choice - home of the world's greatest roast beef sandwiches. Forget all the other chain restaurants that need to come to Springfield - White Castle, What'a'Burger, El Taco - Lion's Choice MUST open a location here in Springfield... TODAY! I don't think I can go much longer without one of their roast-beefy-warmish-to-hotish-type combo meals. Mmmmm... warmish.<br/><br/><b>California Pizza Kitchen</b> - The only alternative for non-family oriented gourmet pizza is South Avenue Pizza Company, which leaves the South side WIDE OPEN. I would kiss three small-to-medium sized billy goats for one of their Thai chicken pizzas.<br/><br/><b>Canyon Cafe</b> - I only mentioned this one because Nicole likes their chips, and Springfield likes mid-range restaurants disguised behind high-end facades.<br/><br/>That's about it. Over the course of writing this post I heated up my Jimmy John's roast beef sandwich and gobbled it down with the ferocity of an Alaskan Grizzly Bear (GRIZZLY MAN opens tomorrow). I'm now a fan of Jimmy John's.<br/><br/>RICH PEOPLE - read these suggestions, go forth, and BUILD! I'm available for consultation seven days a week, so feel free to swing by the theater if you have any questions about setting up your new restaurant(s).",
