Like most theaters across the nation, we're choosing to run the film as NC-17... as in, no one under the age of 18 will be allowed. I'm going to get beat up by a gang of angry high schoolers, aren't I? This will be the first time we've had to check IDs at the door. I bet that will lead to some good <strike>storys</strike> stories. Whew boy!",
