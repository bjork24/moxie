  "body": "Perhaps I spoke too soon. After <a href=\"/posts/31\">Friday's post</a> regarding our decision to name the theater <b>Criterion Cinema</b>, we might have, just maybe, changed our minds... a little. Maybe. We're recanting. We were too hasty in our reporting. As it turns out, Florida is having some problems tallying their votes, so we can't say, with any degree of certainty, who the actual winner is. I bet you're wondering, \"What happened, Dan? I mean, one minute I'm planning my '<b>Criterion Cinema</b> is the winner' celebration party, and now I'm second guessing everything! Is this my child? Is Paul dead? Where's my hat? I just don't know anymore. Damnit Dan, look what you've done! How can this be happening? I demand a recount!\"\r\n\r\nAnd a recount you shall have.\r\n\r\nHere's the skinny: Before we settled on <b>Criterion Cinema</b>, Nicole had her eye on a little name called <b>Moxie</b>. We tossed it around a bit, but for whatever reason, it fell between the cracks. Nicole kept chanting, \"Do you have Moxie? I've got Moxie! Need some Moxie? Here's some Moxie! Smoke this Moxie! Moxie my hat? Speaking of which, where is my hat?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have a hat, sweetie,\" I'd say.\r\n\r\n\"Oh. But I do have Moxie!\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why we eventually decided on <b>Criterion</b> over <b>Moxie</b>, but I have a feeling that alliteration may have played a part in it. I love alliteration. I don't know why... I just do. I always seem to find myself subtly, and not so subtly, slipping similar sounding syllables into my superbly structured sentences all the stinkin' time! Sheesh! Either way, alliteration or no, <b>Criterion Cinema</b> won us over. It took us out to fancy dinners, gave us boxes full of personalized pens, polo shirts, and key chains, it even helped us advance our application to the final tier in this season's casting of <i>Amazing Race</i> (although, unfortunately, we didn't make the final cut). Then came <a href=\"/posts/31\">Friday's post</a>, and everything seemed to be shored up...\r\n\r\n... but <b>Moxie</b> had moxie, and it grabbed us by our scrawny little necks, donked our heads together, and jabbed us in our poochy celiac plexuses! Another translation, sans superfolous personification, would be that Paul, our super cool booking-agent-to-be, e-mailed me and said, \"it's probably a bit late for this, but how about this name for the theater: The Moxie Cinema.\" And just like that, all of the old feelings came rushing back. The more I said it, the more I liked it. Sure, <b>Criterion Cinema</b> sounded more regal and harkened back to the good ole days of giant, palatial theaters, but, like I said earlier, <b>Moxie</b> had moxie, by gum, and it embodied our independent, \"come hell or high water\" spirit.\r\n\r\n<b>moxÂ·ie</b> <i>n. Slang</i> - 1. The ability to face difficulty with spirit and courage. 2. Aggressive energy; initiative. 3. Skill; know-how. (<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=moxie&r=67\" target=\"_blank\">source</a>)\r\n\r\nSounds good to me... but what do you think? When we originally started brainstorming names for the theater we only had a handful of friends and family that we could bounce ideas off of, but now, thanks to this blog, all that's changed. I'm very eager to hear what you think, especially from those of you who have made it a point to stop by on a near daily basis and leave thoughtful, beneficial comments. Tomorrow is my 24th birthday, so you probably won't hear from me again until Wednesday, which should hopefully allow plenty of time for this post to accumulate lots of valid comments regarding the potential name of our theater.\r\n\r\nHow many blogs give its readers the opportunity to pick the name of a super cool, independent, art-house theater? So what will it be: <b>Criterion Cinema</b> or <b>Moxie Cinema</b>? Let your voice be heard. Rock the vote!",
