  "title": "Where's the Moxie sign?",
  "body": "<a href=\"/phlogs/8\">The old, tattered banner that has been hanging on the front of our building for nearly nine months</a> has finally come down. Not because we have a new sign to replace it, but because the city has demanded we take it down or file for a banner permit. Okay. Whatever. The banner is now hanging proudly in our lobby; a relic of all the hard work we put into the theater. Eventually, a nice big marquee is going to grace the front of our building. It will have our logo on the left side, changeable letters (for the showtimes) in the center, and a Dr. Pepper logo on the right side. Coke is paying for the sign ($1,200 - thanks Coca Cola), which means I don't have much of a leg to stand on when it comes to complaining about it not being up yet. I called twice last week - \"it'll be done by the end of this week.\" I called on Monday - \"it's not done, but it's a top priority.\" If I were paying for the sign myself, I'd be a lot more aggressive, but instead I say, \"okay. I'm a complete wuss. Thank you for taking advantage of my patience.\" And then I hang up. Keep your fingers crossed that it will be up soon, as we currently have ZERO signage designating our building as the mythical Moxie.<br/><br/>Speaking of The Moxie being mythical, a unicorn with a Yeti on its back just flew by. Also, a guy (Derek was his name) dropped by before our 4:30 movie and introduced himself to me. He was from San Diego and just happened to be driving through, so he decided to drive downtown and visit the infamous Moxie Cinema. He's planning on building a similar theater in San Diego. It was kind of weird, but cool. I sometimes forget that people other than me and my alter ego (Renaldo) read this blog. What is this thing: \"comments {96}?\" Forum? What the hell, man? What the hell!<br/><br/>I just sent out a newsletter to all the good Moxie boys and girls who are signed up on our mailing list. If you're not already, <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/mail.php\" class=\"broken\">GO SIGN UP RIGHT NOW</a>! You have no idea what you're missing. None! <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/newsletters.php?id=11\" class=\"broken\">Read this right now!</a> That's what you're missing, man.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I just remembered the other thing I was going to write about: THE ARISTOCRATS. Our print of THE ARISTOCRATS arrived today, and upon screening it I realized that it looked (and sounded) like absolute P-O-O-P. There were scratches all over the film, and the sound suffered from a tinny crackle. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the film looked like it had been run through a cheese grater! There were scratches all over the place. I immediately went into \"projection booth emergency mode,\" which basically consists of me posting my problem on <a href=\"http://www.film-tech.com\" target=\"_blank\">film-tech</a> and then running around in circles until someone answers. Here's today's <a href=\"http://www.film-tech.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=007566\" target=\"_blank\">emergency post</a>.<br/><br/>As you can see, the film was in pretty bad condition. It was still watchable, but I have more respect for our audience than to throw a shitty print like that up on the screen. It's all about presentation in this business, and I refuse to project anything less than \"slightly above average.\" Anyways, long story short, I called Technicolor and requested a new print. I didn't expect the film to be here until Thursday, but lo and behold, it's going to be here bright and early in the morning. No one will be subjected to the sub-average print! Yay! Thank you Technicolor!<br/><br/>That's all.",

Springfield seems like a very nice town. The area surrounding the theater has beautiful old houses and huge trees. Overall it seems like a very good location. The interior was very tastefull as well. I wish I would have had time to watch the movie but I guess that will be my motivation to return someday. BTW, I didn't see the yeti or the unicorn; did I miss them? ",
