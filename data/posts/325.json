  "title": "PROOF is good... prove me wrong!",
  "body": "It's a shame when good movies are plagued with mediocre reviews. Case in point: PROOF - the movie we just opened. You have a big name director (John Madden), big name actors (Anthony Hopkins, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jake Gyllenhaal), and a good screen adaption of a prize-winning play. So what's not to like? Personally, I don't know. Nicole and I watched the film today and I enjoyed the hell out of it! I thought the acting was good, the story believable, and the plot twists kept me engaged and guessing to the very end. Honestly, I can't believe that we're the only theater playing it in Springfield. Oh well... their loss, our gain.<br/><br/>Since we're on the topic of reviews and critics, I'd like to toss in a few nuggets of joy. First off, <a href=\"http://www.RottenTomatoes.com\" target=\"_blank\">RottenTomatoes.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.MetaCritic.com\" target=\"_blank\">MetaCritic.com</a> are great, but they're not infallible. When you're dealing with such a small sample group (say, 50 critics or so), it doesn't take much to skew a percentage in any given direction, which is exactly why the majority of films end up falling in the mid-ranges (50 to 75%). A film can have several supporters, quite a few well-wishers, and only a couple detractors and suddenly find itself in the 60-ish percentile, which is exactly why the system is flawed. No matter how good a film is, there's always that one person who decides to hate it just to be different. \"Man, LORD OF THE RINGS totally sucked. It was completely retarded and stupid and Elijah Woods and that guy from \"Lost\" are total douche plugs.\" It's people like that who skew the percentages towards the middle.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and look up the last few films you've seen on your review website of choice. Do they all agree with how you felt about the film? If not, take note of which critics seem to always fall in your corner. I have three critics that act as bellwethers for me: NPR's Kenneth Turan, Slate's David Edelstein, and Chicago's finest, Roger Ebert (say what you will, but the man can rarely be beat... at eating). If I take the scores from these three and average them together, I almost always get a percentage I agree with.<br/><br/>Again, case in point, PROOF:<br/><br/>Roger Ebert = 100<br/>Kenneth Turan = 80<br/>David Edelstein = n/a<br/><br/>My Critic's Percent (M.C.P.) = 90% (and yes, I'd give PROOF a 9 out of 10.)<br/><br/>Now, let's take another movie I recently watched: JARHEAD. If I were to give this movie a concise review, I'd say: \"Following in the footsteps of CONTACT and THE ABYSS, this movie held together up until the end when it collapses in on itself with a sappy, overly dramatic denouement.\" Did I enjoy the film? Yeah, it was alright. I don't regret seeing it, but I doubt I'll be forcing any of my family and friends to catch the next showtime. I'd say my overall feeling about JARHEAD is \"better than average, but the ending ruined it for me.\" Now, let's see how that stacks up with M.C.P.:<br/><br/>Roger Ebert = 88<br/>Kenneth Turan = 50<br/>David Edelstein = 50<br/><br/>My Critic's Percent (M.C.P.) = 63%<br/><br/>And that's pretty much how I felt about the film... 6 out of 10. If the developers of <a href=\"http://www.RottenTomatoes.com\" target=\"_blank\">RottenTomatoes.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.MetaCritic.com\" target=\"_blank\">MetaCritic.com</a> are reading this, please create a section that will allow users to create and track their own personal M.C.P.! I'm tired of figuring up these numbers in my head... or on a nearby calculator.<br/><br/>Finally, what's up with crappy, and not so crappy movies having one word reviews? I mentioned this in my last newsletter, but since I doubt EVERYONE reads EVERY word of those e-mails, I'll repeat it here... knowing full well that EVERYONE reads EVERY word on this blog. Right. Right? Right?! That's what I thought. Seriously though, could the new ZORRO movie not come up with anything other than \"THRILLING\" and \"RIP-ROARING FUN?\" When I see those short reviews, I immediately think they've been taken out of context. \"Zeta-Jones boobs were the most thrilling part of the movie!\" or \"My friend kept rippin' ass during the movie. I swear, I 'bout shit myself trying not to laugh. It was the most rip-roaring fun we'd had outside of a strip club in years! YEARS!\" -Dingleburt Fistybuns, Butte Bugler.<br/><br/>Intermission is nigh. I best be scootin' on.",

And I highly agree with you pointing out Ebert. He respects great independent filmmaking and  art films while at the same time gives props to movies that while may be asthetically or technically weak, still hold up as entertaining films. I always see what he has to say about a film before seeing it. I find most other critics to be too pretentious most of the time.",

That would be incredibly shortsighted of me. <br/><br/>If I were to take that route and play the tyranical theater owner, you could forget ever seeing any Anime, musicals, or anything featuring Elijah Woods.<br/><br/>But look! Here comes EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED! Foiled again!!!<br/><br/>I'm glad we showed LADIES IN LAVENDER, mainly because it brought in a big percentage of new faces who, prior to us having shown the movie, had nothing worth seeing at our theater. They enjoyed the movie and promised to be back. Mission accomplished.<br/><br/>PS - I look forward to taking your student loan money and buying lots and lots of Taco Bell. :)",
