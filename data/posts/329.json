  "body": "I was just outside changing the showtimes for tomorrow's movie on our marquee, right. As per usual, I was engrossed in the act of carefully suctioning each number with my enormous 18 foot suction cup pole when I heard the unmistakable mummerings of a group of drunken girls.<br/><br/>\"Hey dude!\"<br/><br/>I turned to see who was yelling at me, and there, only 5 feet away from me, was a drunk girl flashing her boobs at me. I tried to say something, but, like most guys, I just stood there, pole in hand, and stared at the girl's tatas. This continued for a good 8 or 9 minutes until she pulled her shirt up and said:<br/><br/>\"Cheap thrill, huh!\"<br/><br/>I nodded my head, and just as quickly as it had happened, it was over. The girl walked away, found her car, took off her pants and her underwear, threw on a pair of pajama bottoms, got into her car, and disappeared into the night.<br/><br/>I hope this becomes a nightly occurrence.",
