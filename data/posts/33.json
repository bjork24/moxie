  "body": "It's looks as though the battle lines are being drawn. In the first corner, wearing tails and frilly lace, we have the <b>Criterion Crew</b> [ applause ], and in the second corner, wearing a denim jacket and a half scowl / half smirk, we have the <b>Moxie Mob</b> [ applause ]. To commemorate this epic battle, I had initially planned on unveiling a nice, little flash movie that highlighted some of the pros and cons of each side's stance. Unfortunately, due to my compulsive perfectionism, I was unable to finish it, which leaves me with a lot of nothing to say.\r\n\r\nThis post was only supposed to be a couple sentences long... you know, something like:\r\n\r\n\"Hey everyone, I just spent the last 3 hours building this AMAZING flash movie that depicts the epic battle currently waging betwixt our potential theater names. I'd really be tickled if you'd <a href=\"#\" onClick=\"alert('Alas, this is only an imaginary link. Had I only worked faster this link would\\'ve pulled up a fantasitic movie to dazzle your eyes... but not your ears, because sound files eat up too much bandwidth. You know how it goes. *sigh*'); return false;\">take a look</a>. Thanks. Bye!\"\r\n\r\nNow I don't know what to say. It's like that awkward moment on a first date when you pull up to your favorite restaurant only to find that it's closed for the evening due to a power outage, and your fly is undone. \"Thanks power outage,\"  you would most likely say. \"Thanks a lot.\"\r\n\r\nI often wonder if this blog would make a good book someday... like a beginner's guide to starting your own art-house cinema (unabridged). Thankfully, it's posts like these that keep me head out of the clouds and my grammar sounding like that of a pirate. In parting, I'd like to leave you with a haiku that I'm going to make up as I type.\r\n\r\n<i>meandering post\r\nabout art-house cinema\r\nends with a haiku</I>\r\n\r\nNo, that was too literal. Let me try again.\r\n\r\n<i>damn huge popcorn bags\r\ntempting all with its hugeness\r\nNicole lifts her hand</i>\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave your comments, if any, in the form of a haiku.",
