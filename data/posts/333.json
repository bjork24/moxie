The paper calendars should hopefully be ready by tomorrow. Thanks for your patience.\r\n\r\nOh, and if you're wondering when I'm ever going to get around to fixing all the broken links on this site... keep wondering. Truth is, I'm redesigning the entire thing. Stick with me though, folks... it'll be worth the wait.",
