  "title": "Freakish Moxie Balloons",
  "body": "One month ago today, November 3rd, 2005, the MFAS (Missouri Film Alliance of Springfield) celebrated their organization's first birthday at The Moxie. They brought hor'deurves, pretty table clothes, and a bouquet of balloons filled with so called \"extra helium.\" Apparently this \"extra helium\" was supposed to make the balloons stay afloat longer... and boy does it! One month since the MFAS gala, the balloons are still floating in the air above The Moxie deposit safe. I don't even think they've shrunk!\r\n\r\nTo test this so called \"extra helium,\" I sacrificed one of the balloons and inhaled its contents into my lungs. Immediately upon ingestion, a lifelong mole (who I had affectionately named King Bumby) turned into a Dot (you know, <a href=\"http://www.oldtimecandy.com/dots.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">the candy</a>) and fell onto the floor. I picked King Bumby up, examined him for what seemed to be at least 2 or 3 seconds, and then proceeded to eat him. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"disgusting!\" - but you have to remember, King Bumby wasn't a mole anymore - he was a red Dot!\r\n\r\nHere's a picture of the freakish balloons, along with our film-themed Moxie Christmas tree:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120305/freak_balloons.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120305/tree.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nWe used film instead of garland... aren't we clever! Can you guess what the film is from? No? It's from RENT - a movie I'm going to rate as \"TERRIBLE\" although I haven't seen it. Nicole will surely hit me for writing that.\r\n\r\nAnyways, back to the balloons. If you've seen the balloons and want to share your experiences, banal or not, I've created a <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/forum/index.php?action=vthread&forum=1&topic=78\" class=\"broken\">forum post</a> where you can feel free to tell your balloon stories. If you haven't seen the balloons yet, make sure to check them out next time you're in. I'll keep the forum post updated until the balloons die... if they ever do!",
