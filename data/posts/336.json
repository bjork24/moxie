  "body": "We just found out from Paul, our awesome film booker, that Warner Independent has invited us to be a debut theater for Albert Brooks' new <strike>documentary</strike> comedy, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433116/\" target=\"_blank\">LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD</a>. Now when you hear \"showing in select cities\" you won't have to drive all the way up to Chicago to find a \"select city\"... at least for this film. The movie is scheduled for a limited release on February 10th, but we'll be showing it well before that. Woo hoo! Maybe if we do good with LOOKING FOR COMEDY, they'll keep us as a debut theater for even more of their films. Then the other distributors would follow suit, then Brad Pitt would proclaim The Moxie as the greatest theater ever during his next interview on Dateline NBC, then Angelina would lock herself in the vault, and then Bjork and I would have babies together! How sweet would that be? Let me answer for you: friggin' sweet!<br/><br/>Also, don't forget about the BEARDED CHILD FILM FESTIVAL tonight. It's going to be AWESOME! And for all you college students who are choosing to \"study\" instead of come to the theater, I've got news for you - secondary education is over-rated. Look at me, I'm an English major for Pete's sake! Peter Gabriel's sake, that is. Woo hoo! Shock the monkey and swing by the theater or else you'll risk getting a poor grade on your COOLNESS grade card!<br/><br/>Aside: I used to study a lot too. I understand. NOT!",

It's a period piece, for God sakes, but who's starring in it? Kirsten Dunst! Jason Schwartzman! WTF? And what music is playing throughout the entire trailer? New Order! Freaking New Order!<br/><br/>This had better be the most brilliant thing I have ever seen. Do you think Kirsten will dance on a bed in some ruffly panties?",
