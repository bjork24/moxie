Well done! Now all you have to do is master the \"layering\" and putting sound files on!<br/>As for the cinema names - I'm not keen on either. Criterion sounds like a baddie in  one of those terrible X-men comics and Moxie rhymes with Poxy!<br/>Our local cinema is called the Regal which is as good a name as any.
