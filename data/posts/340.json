  "body": "Two HUGE events happened today.<br/><br/>1. Nicole and I became an aunt and uncle when my sister gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Ivy at 8:08 pm.<br/><br/>1. At 8:30 pm, less than thirty minutes after my niece had arrived into this world, the Moxie's baby - our 35mm projector - broke like Saddam's prosecuting attorney. We had to cancel our 9:15 show (a first  in Moxie history) and send 12 people home empty-handed. Why couldn't this have happened during THE WILD PARROTS OF TELEGRAPH HILL? I don't think anyone would've noticed had we canceled a show or two of that movie (despite how wonderful it was). NO! The projector HAD to break during our BIGGEST night of December. We were on goal to beat last Friday and Saturday... COMBINED!<br/><br/>I tore into the heart of the beast this evening and extracted the malignant tumor. If all goes well tomorrow, I should have her up and running by noon... ish. Wish me luck. Here are some gory pictures:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/122205/bork1.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/122205/bork2.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/122205/bork3.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/122205/bork4.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>I'll explain more tomorrow. Again, a HUGE apology to all of the wonderful people who tried to come to the 9:15 show... especially the couple that even hired a babysitter just for the occasion. I feel so, so, SO bad. As Benzo as my witness, that projector will run again!",
