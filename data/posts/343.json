  "body": "I'm not going to beat around the bush here. Our preshow ads, as funny as there are (were), are getting old. I threw together about a dozen of them way back in September, but haven't gotten around to making new ones for quite some time. So in the tradition of all things Moxie, I'm going to let the patients takeover the asylum... or some other such metaphor that equates to letting you build the ads yourself.\r\n\r\nJust think, your work could be seen by tens of tens of people! Your voracious wit could be splitting up several people before every movie we show! What more could you ask for? A template, you say? Ok, here's a basic one for you: <a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/122805/slide.psd\">PhotoShop template for Moxie slide</a>. That doesn't mean, however, that you need to limit yourself to the standard Moxie look. As long as the ad fits our size requirements and content approval we'll show it.\r\n\r\nHere are the specifications:\r\n\r\nSize: 1024 x 768\r\nType: JPEG\r\nSend: slides [AT] moxiecinema [DOT] com\r\n\r\nSlides that need to be made, but haven't been yet:\r\n\r\n1. A slide discouraging cell phone use\r\n2. A slide discouraging talking\r\n3. A slide that subtly urges people to buy more concessions\r\n4. Funny movie trivia slides (see <a href=\"/posts/169\">here</a> for examples)\r\n5. A slide advertising the fact that businesses can buy ads for advertising... their business\r\n6. A slide about the moxie blog\r\n\r\nIf your slide passes the approval test (not too offensive, somewhat humorous, etc.), I'll reply to your e-mail and post your brilliant piece of slide artwork right here on the blog for all to see. This (preshow slide submission) will be included in the upcoming Moxie Website 2.0 as a standard feature, but I wanted to let you guys have the first crack at it. So knock yourself out, good readers.\r\n\r\nPS - Sorry I haven't been posting as much lately. The end of the month tends to be a very busy time, especially when it's crammed with holidays and births. I'll post November and December's numbers in the near future.\r\n",
