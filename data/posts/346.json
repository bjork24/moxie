  "title": "Your favorite Moxie movie of 2005",
  "body": "I meant to ask this early, but it slipped my mind. Quite simply, what were your favorite Moxie movies of 2005? For me, I'd say my favorites were, in order:<br/><br/>1. Murderball<br/>2. El Crimen Perfecto<br/>3. Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room<br/>4. Me and You and Everyone We Know<br/>5. Never Been Thawed<br/>6. Proof<br/>7. The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till<br/><br/>I'm assuming that JUNEBUG, THE WILD PARROTS OF TELEGRAPH HILL, and THE SQUID AND THE WHALE would have made it too, but like the majority of people in Springfield, I didn't have time to watch them. Out of all the movies we showed in 2005, I only had time to watch 14 out of the 26 all the way through. Typically I only get a chance to watch the first 10 minutes to make sure the sound and picture is okay, but after that... who knows if I'll get a chance to watch it all the way through. That's a definite new year's resolution for me: watch more of the movies we show.<br/><br/>And in case you forgot, here's a rundown of all the movies we played in 2005 (not counting special screenings - i.e. HAROLD & MAUDE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, etc.):<br/><br/><ul><li>ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW</li><br/><li>MURDERBALL</li><br/><li>ROCK N' ROLL SPACE PATROL</li><br/><li>BROKEN FLOWERS</li><br/><li>SAVING FACE</li><br/><li>GRIZZLY MAN</li><br/><li>THE ARISTOCRATS</li><br/><li>LADIES IN LAVENDER</li><br/><li>PROOF</li><br/><li>HAPPY ENDINGS</li><br/><li>THUMBSUCKER</li><br/><li>ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM</li><br/><li>EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED</li><br/><li>THE ANIMATION SHOW</li><br/><li>FLYING TIGER</li><br/><li>MIRRORMASK</li><br/><li>JUNEBUG</li><br/><li>2046</li><br/><li>HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE</li><br/><li>THE WILD PARROTS OF TELEGRAPH HILL</li><br/><li>WAL-MART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE</li><br/><li>NEVER BEEN THAWED</li><br/><li>THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL</li><br/><li>THE SQUID AND THE WHALE</li><br/><li>A PIANO BY CHRISTMAS</li><br/><li>EL CRIMEN PERFECTO</li></ul><br/>So, what were your favorites?",

      "body": "I only saw seven of them, which is unbelievably depressing, but I can honestly say I liked every one. The Aristocrats was hilarious, Ladies In Lavender was touching, Proof was really very good,  The Animation Show was quite enjoyable, Murderball was just plain awesome, and Broken Flowers was the highlight of the week when I saw it. Still, I think Me And You And Everyone We Know was probably my favorite. Of course, I really had a fantastic time at the blog readers prescreening I saw with Amelie. I'm a little bitter that I was in Germany the whole time The Squid And The Whale showed. Also, several other films were unfortunately timed with exams and whatnot. Nonetheless, The Moxie made my semester truly amazing, and I fully intend to continue to patronize your theater for a great while. Thank you Moxie Dan and Moxie Nicole! See you soon :-)",

I live outside of the other side of town and have little to no money.  It's sometime hard to justify an 1/8 tank of gas and $6 over a trip down the road to Family Video.  That should change next semester, as I have been forced to take a night class in that area.",
