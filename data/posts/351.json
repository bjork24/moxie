What if, right in the middle of the interview, you bonked him in the nads with the microphone?! Yeah! That would be hilarious! It would make that ultra-satisfying \"thunk\" noise and everyone would laugh. Of course, you'd probably be killed within the hour by Diddy's entourage, but the endless airtime that the \"thunk\" moment would get would be well worth it.",
