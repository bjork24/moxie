Thanks for your help putting them up, Dad!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/012906/lights.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nThose lights, by the way, only cost me $30 a piece. I bought them from a farm equipment outlet store, where they're known as \"barn lights.\" Despite their moniker, they look exactly like the lights everyone else has up downtown. Had I bought similar lights through a lighting store, they would've cost me $120+ a piece. Team Moxie scores again!",
