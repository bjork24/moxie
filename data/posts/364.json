  "body": "Here it is: the new Moxie Online Experience, version TWO POINT OH! Feel free to have a look around... you'll be surprised by how many dead links you <i>won't</i> find. There are still a few pages that have yet to roll out, but I'm not going to show them on the menu until they're 100% ready. Also, the new mod_rewrite structure might cause a few of the old blog links to not work, but I'll fix that shortly.<br/><br/>Sorry it took me so long to unveil the new design. Hopefully it was worth the wait. Send me your bugs, your huddled masses of design flaws, and your complaints. Either <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/contact\" class=\"broken\">via e-mail</a> or through the <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/suggest\" class=\"broken\">new suggestion page</a>. Woo hoo!",
