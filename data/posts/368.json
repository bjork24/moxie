Now none of those people will realize that they were a part of Moxie history, and that their names will be taught in history classes years from now.<br/><br/>On a side note, I was asked the classic \"if a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around, does it make a sound?\" question earlier today. My answer: \"Yes, it makes a sound, but it can only be heard by either Chuck Norris or Werner Herzog; depending on which one isn't being shot at that particular moment.\" Just thought I'd mention that.<br/><br/>500 shows! Woo hoo! We're AWESOME!",

I have NO clue. #24 is a cult classic from not long ago, but that's all I'm saying.<br/><br/>The Moxie should have a contest like this. Except make them a little harder and make a lot of them from movies you've shown and indie classics. No big studio ones that are obvious like Mensa did. ",
