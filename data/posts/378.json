  "title": "The Dark Art of Booking a Single Screen Cinema",
  "body": "This post has been waiting in the wings for far too long. I've seriously been trying to write it for well over four months, but every time I start to type, something more pressing comes along... like an iron, set to full steam! That, my friends, is comedy gold. So, as the title suggests, today's topic will be \"The Dark Art of Booking a Single Screen Cinema,\" but before I go on at length about the fineries of film \"felection\" (I had to maintain alliteration... at all costs!), let me spit out a few side notes:<br/><br/>1. The Oscars were strange, to say the least. Who would've predicted that CRASH would win? Not me. That's all.<br/><br/>2. We had a tie for the winner of our Oscar poll. Both scored an impressive 10 out of 12, but neither of them correctly predicted the live action short film winner (SIX SHOOTER? Come on!), which meant we had to draw the winner at random. After an intense game of \"pick which hand the winning ballot is in,\" the winner was chosen and contacted. I'm not sure if she wants her name mentioned on the blog, so I'll just direct my congratulations to M(r)s. Winner McWinnington.<br/><br/>3. This weekend has been INSANE! We had THREE sold out shows for TRANSAMERICA - one on Friday, one on Saturday, and one on Sunday - and it doesn't show any sign of letting up! Thank you TRANSAMERICA! Thank you CAPS LOCK!<br/><br/>Ok, let's get into the good stuff, shall we?!?!?! Remember, punctuation is our friend!!!!!11<br/><br/>Booking films is hard work... especially when you have to schedule an entire month at one time. Most theaters book on a week-by-week basis, which frees them up to carry over films that preform well and drop those that don't. However, this sort of \"on-the-fly\" scheduling comes at a cost. If your movies are changing every seven days, you have to make darn sure your audience knows what's playing, which makes daily advertising a necessity. I won't go into all the pros and cons of the various types of scheduling - <a href=\"/posts/16\">I did that nearly two years ago</a> - I just wanted to set the stage for my explanation of why many distributors hate working with \"calendar house\" theaters like The Moxie.<br/><br/>One word, six syllables: inflexibility. Good for steel beams and corsets, bad for gymnasts and movie theaters. Our inability to hold movies longer than our predetermined run has cost us a few titles in the past. For example, when CAPOTE opened in limited release way back in early October, we were all over it. We put in our bid early and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, since the film was so new, and the prints so limited, the distribution company would only let us play it if we agreed to a four week exclusive engagement - meaning we could show nothing but CAPOTE for the entire month of November (death for a single-screen theater). On top of that, they didn't want us to print a calender for the preceding month, so THEY could make the final decision of when we stopped playing THEIR film. We baulked at their demands (obviously) and decided to hold off until more prints were released. Nothing changed in December or January, but February was starting to look promising. CAPOTE had expanded its print run and would now be available in the smaller markets. Again, for the third month in a row, we expressed our sincere interest in showing film, but unfortunately it was too late... once the Oscar nominations were announced in late January, Campbell Suxteen swept in and stole it from us. Of course, they had no problem throwing it on one of their smaller screens and playing it for a month... they, unlike us, have the flexibility to do that. To add salt to our already oozing wounds, Campbell also stole GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK right from under us, and didn't even wind up showing it in February... like we had planned!<br/><br/>What a sad story, eh? Oh well. What can you do? Competition is competition. Life goes on. No use crying over spilled milk. Live and learn...<br/><br/>Damn you Campbell... damn you to hell!<br/><br/>Right... so where was I? Oh yes, the typical timeline of a film booking. Here's how most people think we book films - or, should I say, here's how my highly over-generalizing mind's eye <i>assumes</i> most people think we book films:<br/><br/><b>Customer:</b> You should show MATCH POINT. I really want to see that.<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Ok. (calls distribution company) Hi, we'd like to show MATCH POINT.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> You would? Great! We'd love to have it shown in your market. When would you like to show it?<br/><b>Moxie:</b> How about March 10th through the 24th.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> That would be fine. We'll have it shipped to you by the 9th. Thank you for your interest in our film!<br/><b>Moxie:</b> You're welcome. Have a wonderful day.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> Likewise. Bye bye.<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Good bye. (turns to customer) I have good news!<br/><b>Customer:</b> Yeah?<br/><b>Moxie:</b> MATCH POINT will be starting on the 10th.<br/><b>Customer:</b> That's fantastic! You've earned my continued business yet again!<br/><br/>If only it were that easy... earning someone's continued business. Here's how a more typical booking goes:<br/><br/><b>Customer:</b> You should show MATCH POINT. I really want to see that.<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Ok. (calls distribution company) Hi, we'd like to show MATCH POINT.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> Don't you know it's a Monday?! We don't book on Mondays. (hangs up)<br/><b>Moxie:</b> (stunned) Oh my.<br/><br/>NEXT DAY<br/><br/><b>Moxie:</b> (calls distribution company) Hi, we'd like to show MATCH POINT.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> Oh really? What is your theater's capacity?<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Seventy-five.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha (hangs up)<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Damn! (calls another distributor) Hello, we'd really like to show BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> Ok, we can do that.<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Woo hoo!<br/><br/>NEXT DAY<br/><br/><b>Distributor:</b> Hi, is this Moxie?<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Yes, this is Moxie.<br/><b>Distributor:</b> Campbell wants BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, and they have more seats than you, so... have a good day.<br/><b>Moxie:</b> Damn! (calls another distributor)<br/><br/>And on and on and on. If Campbell wants a movie that we're trying to show, they will get it. No contest. It's a shitty policy, but distributors are looking at the bottom dollar, not the ambiance between two venues. Campbell can throw a movie into one of its smallest auditoriums and play it six or seven times a day, and that's what distributors like to hear. Who cares if more people would turn up to see it at The Moxie... seats equate to box office revenue, and when there's only so many prints to go around... you know the rest.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Campbell has woken up over the last couple months and started fighting us for several films. I have mixed feelings about this: I'm glad smaller films are getting shown in Springfield, whether it's at our theater or somewhere else (although I'd obviously prefer it to be at ours); I'm mad that Campbell is stealing our movies, but at the same time I'm flattered that they consider us enough of a threat to snipe from us (and steal our idea for popcorn flavors); if we weren't around, do you think Campbell would still be focusing (even slightly) on bringing in smaller films? Seriously?<br/><br/>We'll see how the dynamic changes when (if ever) the supposed Hollywood 14 opens two blocks North of us. Will Campbell still be taking sucker punches at us, or will they need to focus on their new, bigger adversary? Competition being what it is, I still have respect for the ol' suxteen. At the end of the day, we're all in the same boat... even if ours is a lot less gaudy than theirs.<br/><br/>Wasn't this post supposed to be about booking? I've totally lost my way, and now I'm hopelessly mired in some offshoot rant about Campbell. How did that happen? Let me try, one last time, to give a concise breakdown of the factors that go into whether or not we get a film:<br/><br/><ul><li><b>Type of release -</b> If it's in limited release, our chances are slim to none for getting it on the break (close to its release date). Occasionally we're honored with a spot on the top tier (ala LOOKING FOR COMEDY), but most of the time we have to wait for the film to do it's victory march up and down the coasts.</li><br/><li><b>Number of prints -</b> If there are only 10 prints of the film, you can bet we won't be getting it within the first 3 or 4 months of release. This is usually the case when a film is still on the festival circuit. Just because a cool film shows at Sundance or SXSW doesn't mean it's available to commercial theaters.</li><br/><li><b>Borderline films -</b> They're kinda big (budget over $5,000,000), but yet they're kinda art-house (witty, smart, stylish, provocative, etc.) - these films form the battlefield that separates us from Campbell Suxteen... expect more major battles to flare up over the next few months.</li><br/><li><b>Trust and size -</b> Some distributors simply don't trust us. They think our theater is too small for their movies, and even if we're the only venue in the Springfield market actively pursuing their film... it doesn't matter. They'd rather save their prints for towns that have larger theaters and more established payment histories.</li></ul><br/>Well, that about does it for me.

      "body": "Dan:<br/><br/>Thanks for the post--it really helps with my perspective.  I think I've learned a few things but most of all it seems that butts in seats equals power with distributors.  I haven't been to see as many movies as I should at the Moxie due to fear--what if I don't like it?  My fear factor is generally unfounded, I'm sure, but the descriptions in the Moxie newsletter/RSS feed don't do very much to encourage me to plant my butt in the seat.<br/><br/>I'm a customer that wants to hear from people who've seen the movie before I go.  That's true for any venue, any theater.  I choose to only go to the Moxie for the atmosphere first and the content second.  Heck, I'd go if you were only showing uncensored Family Guy episodes that I had seen hundreds of times.  That's because I know and can control my biggest concerns: atmosphere and content quality.<br/><br/>Back to the descriptions...<br/><br/>I recognize as a consumer, I have a responsibility to dig a little deeper after reading the Moxie newsletter to see what I can find out about these films.  I'll vow to do more of that in the future.  Do you and Nicole get a chance to see these films before they are shown?  Can you give us a \"rundown\" of what you think?<br/><br/>Dan, I'm invested in you and Nicole as movie people who happen to run a theater.  If you review a movie that you're showing, say you don't like a it but point out the strong points, you're starting the conversation.  You're encouraging me to \"get my butt in the seat\" and form my own opinion.  Remember that due to the content you're showing and the location of the theater, your audience is (likely) more intelligent than the average moviegoer.  Try engaging their brain before they hit the door.  Once they're here, the movie will do the rest.<br/><br/>Final note:  partial RSS feeds suck.  Give Moxie customers a way to access full feeds somehow.  I read every one of your weblog posts and the constant click through is tedious.  If you're concerned about stats, try Feedburner.<br/><br/>Steve<br/><br/>PS:  If this sounds like a rant, I'm sorry.  If I didn't care, I wouldn't write.",

It's only unfortunate that they (being Hollywood in general) won't recognize what killed \"going out to see a movie\" until it's too late.

Not understanding that people don't <b>want</b> to listen to cell phones go off, children crying, or high school kids talking, they refuse to believe that smaller niche theatres are the way of the future.

It's bizarre - it means they're competing for a segment of the market that they didn't care about before, and - should they suddenly become the victors - would immediately cease to care about thereafter.  Competition is competition, I agree, but that's just viciousness that actively works to lower our quality of life.<br/><br/>And seems to me like someone needs a LOT of encouragement before pulling the trigger to see a movie.

My \"fear\" is that I won't enjoy spending my free time at a particular movie versus spending time doing something I already know is fun/relaxing/engaging/whatever.  Take restaurants for example.  Do you walk in to just any restaurant to eat a meal?  Do you possibly read the menu online, talk about it with others who have been there and even read a restaurant review in the paper before going?  How much convincing to you need before you try anything new in life?  Don't define \"fear\" by traditional methods.<br/><br/>The point isn't that if I need my ass kissed before I give Dan and Nicoloe $8 for a ticket.  The real issue is with so many options for entertainment (TiVo'd shows, conversation over coffee, video games) I need to be more engaged by the Moxie before I'll move my \"butt\" from one seat to another.  Dan's weblog engaged me during the Moxie startup, but I'm finding that I'm not being pulled in for the movies.  Here's a suggestion:  user movie reviews from regulars.  Use their experience to pull me in and make me want to be part of the Moxie community and a Moxie regular.<br/><br/>As far as your \"timid\" comment about me, it's out of line.  If you wouldn't say it sitting across a table from me in the same room, you shouldn't say it all.<br/><br/>Steve<br/><br/>PS -- Dan, I promote the Moxie at every opportunity, talking about the environment, the popcorn and most of all, the people who make it happen.

      "body": "Steve, et al:<br/><br/>A long time ago, when I was a student in Columbia, I worked at The Blue Note, which is an incredible live music treasure, back when it was a warehouse off of I-70.  There were people who would pick and choose the shows that they wanted to see, having a pretty good idea what they would hear and expect, and stay home or do other worthwhile things if what they had read or heard didn't necessarily strike their fancy.  There were others, however, that utilized the venue in an entirely different manner.  They were the ones who would walk up, pay their 8 to 10 bucks, get their hand stamped then ask, \"Who's playing?\" before strolling into the void.  These devotees were loyal and adventurous, and knew that on any given night magic might happen.  They were also the heart and soul of The Blue Note  One night they may see the Belairs for the millionth time, an unknown SoCal band named Red Hot Chili Peppers, a reggae act direct from Jamaica, a jazz act like Sun Ra and his Arkestra...or they may see a real clunker.  That was part of the adventure.  Unless you got beer spilled on you or worse, you were guaranteed an experience, based on the creative and well informed bookings of Richard King, the proprietor.<br/><br/>You get the analogy.  Perhaps The Moxie should be approached in the same way.  Either go in informed, or just find out when the show starts.  Show up.  You may see the next great sleeper or a documentary about genital mutilation.  Hopefully, whichever method will provide for an enjoyable time and you'll go away having enjoyed the experience.  Far be it for me to say, but that may be the ideal approach, someone who plunks down the change, buys a bag of popcorn and a beer, then asks, \"So, what's playing?\"<br/>  <br/>",

I’d probably say it with a wink and a smile, but I’d still say it.  You can ask people who know me, some of whom have posted here, about my unfortunate lack of social tact.  It can exhibit itself on blogs or across tables.<br/><br/>You obviously care enough to write detailed posts, Steve, so I don’t question you on that, and this is a pretty light hearted website, so I don’t want to turn it in to instapundit.  But this is a discussion worth having, so I’ll respond to your response and leave it.  Promise.<br/><br/>Actually, Steve, I don’t need a lot of prompting to try a new restaurant.  Spontaneous visits to new restaurants are one of my favorite things to do.  Again, ask my friends!  Maybe I drive by it, or I’ve heard one or two things about it.  But that’s about it.  <br/>New downtown steakhouse?  Sold!  It’s a steakhouse!  It’s a house with steaks!  It’s downtown!  Who needs anything else?  Pacific Rim fusion?  What the hell’s that?  Who cares!  Pile up my plate with some Chilean Sea Bass you crazy Ocean Zen you!<br/><br/>You see?  I kinda feel the same way about movies, the “options of modern life” notwithstanding.  Options are just that.  Options to choose, and I don’t need to synthesize several sources of research (citing them in an MLA formatted bibliography of course) before making a leap.<br/><br/>But this is all beside the point.  In your first post, however you may wish to clarify it later, you give a pretty clear impression that the worst thing in the world would be for you to see a movie that you didn’t absolutely love.  You say you want opinions from multiple people:  your friends, customer reviews on the blog, reviews from Dan and Nicole.  This is even after you say, “My fear factor is generally unfounded, I'm sure.”  <br/>Yes, I understand your flexible use of the word “fear,” but we are talking about the same effect, in any case.  <br/><br/>If you didn’t mean to sound stricken by paralysis, I apologize.  My post was aggressive.  But…well…you did.  Sound stricken by paralysis, I mean.<br/><br/>I’ve eaten at bad restaurants and I’ve seen bad movies.  None of it was truly wasted time.  It’s how I know what the good ones are.<br/><br/>I liked evilvet’s memories of the Blue Note, and the implied comparison, but I don’t think anyone’s asking you to be the “heart and soul” of the Moxie, should you choose not to.  In your first post, however, you seem to be asking a lot from people before you decide to see a movie there.  You want to give the impression that it is the lack of information that is the only reason you’ve stayed away, but for some reason I doubt that’s it (there are also other tireless promoters of the theatre that have been so gosh-golly-gee thrilled that it’s here that they’ve made it a habit, knowing that some movies will suck, some will be good, and a few will be through the roof great.) <br/><br/>You don’t have to make it a habit, but gosh, there have been, like, what, close to 50 movies so far?  Jesus, see one already.  I will personally, to your face I mean, buy you a Fitz’s root beer or an Oatmeal Stout.  Those are two of my favorites, anyway.  YOU may want to research it first!  ;-)<br/><br/>I can drop a whole bunch more smiley emoticons if it helps.  <br/>;-) ;-) ;-)<br/>",

I saw War of the Worlds this summer based on my love for the original radio play and on none other than movie reviews. Critics for the most part seemed to love it (73% on Rotten Tomatoes). So I gathered some friends and went. That was definitley 2 hours of my life completely wasted. Shame on you Spielberg. He could learn something from Peter Jackson, methinks. Make a big budget special FX movie and have a good story on top of it? WOW!<br/><br/>This seems like the wrong post to mention this on, but I hope you guys get <i>Paris, je t'aime</i> this summer or next fall.",
