  "body": "Instead of just saying: \"HEY! Here's what we're showing in May,\" I'm going to show you a picture from each movie and let you figure it out. Most of them are pretty easy, but there might be one or two in there that you have to use your ol' noggin to figure out. As for the line-up, I'm really excited about it (especially the second to last one). Two of the movies we were hoping to show in May have been pushed back a month, which means our June calendar is all but scheduled... and it's going to be pretty dang spectacular. Ok, here come the May movies:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/01.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 3 through 9<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/02.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 5 through 7<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/03.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 10 through 18<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/04.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 12, 13, 15, 16<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/05.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 10 through 18<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/06.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 19 through 30<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/07.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 20<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/042606/08.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/>May 25 through TBD<br/><br/>I'll be by later to confirm or deny your guesses... or, Master RJ will be by and guess them all correctly in his first guess. Either way, it's all good fun.",
