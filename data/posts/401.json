  "body": "I'm sure this article isn't indicative of how everyone feels in Hollywood, but it's one of the first optimistic pieces I've read about the decline in theater attendence. The article is written by Lynda Obst, who produced such money-making films as FLASHDANCE, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, and most recently, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS. I thought you guys might enjoy reading it, and have a comment or two about the conclusion.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://newyorkmetro.com/news/media/westcoastoffice/16770/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">We Lost It at the Movies</a>",
