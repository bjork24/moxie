  "body": "Here's a <a href=\"/episodes/6\">new episode of MoxieTV</a> for you to lambast. It's the shortest one to date, but there's only so much you can do with a bunch of rubber snakes.\r\n\r\nAnd now for something completely different: an animated gif of Chuck Norris popping some blonde in the nose. It's only funny because it's Chuck. *sigh* If only we could get him to do a MoxieTV episode with us... if only.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/050206/chuck.gif\" width=\"170\" />",
