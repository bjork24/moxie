  "body": "Well, I don't have much to report today. We're still making progress, slowly but surely. Nicole is working with an interior decorator who was kind enough to volunteer her services in exchange for free advertising and a few movie tickets. I'm still waiting to hear back from our equipment dealer, but it may be a couple more days since I'm guessing he's onsite at an out-of-state project. In the meantime, I'm busying myself with business plan revisions and website tinkering.\r\n\r\n<b>SPEAKING OF WEBSITES:</b> I'm currently trying to wean myself off of table-driven layout and embrace CSS-P wholeheartedly, but I'll be damned if it isn't the hardest thing I've ever done in my life! I can typically pick up a new web language (or in the case of CSS, new web syntax) in a week or so, but this is like relearning the English language without using our standard 26-letter alphabet. It's hard!\r\n\r\n<b>RIDDLE:</b> How many letters are in the alphabet?\r\n\r\n<b>THE LURE OF BLOGGING:</b> What is it about blogging that's so appealing? Before starting this one, I'd never read a blog in my life, but now I read all kinds. If a visitor leaves a comment with a URL on one of my posts, I always take the time to go and read through their blog. They're addicting, I tells ya. A very unusual, and research-worthy, social/cyber construct, to be sure.\r\n\r\n<b>VIRTUAL ANONYMITY:</b> I also find it strange, yet intriguing, that beyond this blog, no one has any idea who I am, what I look like, or where my hat is. Of course, that intrigue goes both ways. When I read other people's blogs (those that don't provide pictures, that is), I often find myself envisioning what the author looks like based on their posts. I do that a lot - when I talk to people on the phone, when I hear a new band on the radio, when I read an article in the newspaper or in a magazine - I'm always trying to envision what the person looks like.\r\n\r\n<b>WHERE AM I GOING WITH THIS?:</b> I'm not sure. I know I promised to keep my posts \"theater-oriented,\" but I couldn't help myself. Although, since this blog is a construct and/or result of starting the theater, I suppose talking about it could be considered \"theater-oriented\" chatter.\r\n\r\n<b>EXAMPLE OF NON-THEATER-ORIENTED CHATTER:</b> Does anyone else think Colin, from the Colin and Christie team of <i>Amazing Race</i>, looks like Luke Skywalker? Seriously. Check <a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/151_luke_colin.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> out if you don't believe me.\r\n\r\n<b>LO, LO, LO, LOGOS:</b> I'd like to extend a hardy thank you to everyone who took the time submit a logo for <b>The Moxie</b>. For those of you who haven't submitted one yet, there's still time. The polls are open until 12:00 am on July 31st, after which time all entries will be either burned or eaten.\r\n\r\n<b>RIDDLE ANSWER:</b> There are 11 letters in the alphabet.",

It's funny because I thought it was a fad and none of us would be keeping up with it for as long as we have. I've been doing mine for around seven months now. It's still mostly only read by the friends that conned... er... coaxed me into it in the first place. Of the group I started with, I think I update my blog much more frequently than the rest of them (even though I haven't done so in about a week, for shame!). I keep doing it 'cause I kind of enjoy it. It's therapeutic in a weird sort of way to put your personal affairs out in public site without anyone REALLY knowing who you are.",
