  "body": "Hello. I haven't written much lately, have I? I'm not sure what's been keeping me from posting lately... maybe it's the fact that not much has been going on around here, or that I just haven't been in the mood to write much lately (I go through cycles). Either way, here we are. Hmmm.<br/><br/>Do you know that in TWO days this blog will be TWO years old? Can you believe that?! That's twice as old as the theater itself! Did you know that two human years equates to roughly 89 years in the life of a blog. It's true. I'll mark the date by making a big announcement about the theater on Wednesday. Woo hoo!<br/><br/>In other news, BETTIE PAGE has been performing quite well over the last three days, and I think it's only going to get better when we open THE PROMISE to play along side her. And for those of you who don't get our newsletter, here's a partial peek at what's coming up in June (in guess the picture form):<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/01.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/02.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/03.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/04.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/05.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/06.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/07.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/08.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/052206/09.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>We're still waiting on one more film to round out our schedule... and it's a much-requested one too. Other than that, more news to follow!",

It opens at the end of June so I thought maybe you could get it by then. It looks pretty one-sided, but I think people don't care about politics anymore when it comes to gas prices.",
