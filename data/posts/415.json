I could've gone my whole life without needing to see that.\"</i><br/><br/><i>\"Intense. Incredibly intense.\"</i><br/><br/><i>\"Where are your restrooms?\"</i><br/><br/><i>\"That. Was. Freaky. Uncomfortable freaky.\"</i><br/><br/>",

I think the synopsis describes it quite well when it mentions not being able to identify the \"good guy.\"  That's part of what makes it such an intense and unique film.  If they would have ended it sooner - there were several opportunities that it could have ended, it would have lost that edge.  Without that, it wouldn't be worth watching.  <br/><br/>It's only uncomfortable because you don't know whose side to be on.  No one likes their morals and values to be questioned.<br/><br/>Watch the movie!!  :)",
