  "body": "BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is one of greatest movies of all time. <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Kottke</a>, world reknowned blogger, also happens to <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/06/06/bill-and-teds-excellent-adventure\" target=\"_blank\">agree with me</a>.\r\n\r\n<quote>I know I'm going to get mail about my five-star rating for this movie, but it cannot be helped. One summer when I was a kid, a friend and I watched Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure -- no joke -- every single day for a span of 2 months. I still know every line by heart, the timing, inflection, everything. If there were a Broadway production of this movie, I could slide effortlessly into the role of either Bill S. Preston, Esq. or Ted Theodore Logan, no rehearsal needed.</quote>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why I'm telling everyone this... I guess I just needed some vindication. I'm going to shoot Kottke an e-mail and inform him about \"<a href=\"http://www.billandted.org/musicalhome.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Bill and Ted's Excellent Musical Adventure</a>,\" an amateur musical about my favorite time travelling duo (complete with <a href=\"http://www.billandted.org/musical02.html\" target=\"_blank\">soundtrack</a> and <a href=\"http://www.glenncarter.com/mate/b&t.doc\" target=\"_blank\">script</a>)!\r\n\r\nWYLD STALLYNS!!!",

At one point, when was eleven, it was my favorite movie and also the first DVD I ever bought (haven't got the boxed set though). But then I started watching R-rated movies and Turner Classic Movies.",
