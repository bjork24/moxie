  "body": "We made a trip over to the Old Firehouse on Commercial Street last night to test out the projector. I was afraid the image wouldn't look bright enough from our planned set-up point, but boy was I wrong. The image looks incredible! It's huge!!! I think this will be one of the best Moxie A Go-Go's to date. There's going to be beer and popcorn (just like at the theater), and all the concession proceeds will go to the Commercial Club, which is the organization responsible for the continuing renovation of the Commercial Street district. Here's a super sweet mock-up of how everything's going to play out:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/061206/setup.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nJust to the East of the firehouse is a big open garden, where everyone will be encouraged to sprawl out and watch the film. Bordering the opposite side of the garden is an old three story building that's been painted stark white... that's our screen. To give you an idea of how large the image will be, here's yet another descriptive picture:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/061206/image.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nAs you can see, even Charles Atlas himself is dwarfed by the gigantic visage of Yakov's head, which is in turn smurfed by the mightiness of Buster Keaton's torso! It's spectacular! Now I'm trying to think of more reasons to utilize this amazing space. Too good to believe? Show up Saturday night and see for yourself. It's gonna rock your block into your sock, doc!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/mp3/dean.mp3\">*Howard Dean yell*</a>",
