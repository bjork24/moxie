  "body": "Moxie A Go-Go isn't the only <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_cinema\" target=\"_blank\">mobile cinema</a> on the scene (although some might argue that it's the best). The UK has quite a few, including <a href=\"http://shootingpeople.org/mobilecinema/index.php?section=what\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">this little one</a> that operates out of a VW van. If I were to guess, I'd say the best known cinema on wheels belongs to <a href=\"http://www.originalalamo.com/RRS/frames.asp\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">the Alamo Drafthouse</a>. They actually have TWO 35mm projectors running out of the back of a modified moving van.\r\n\r\nFor the more DIY spirits among you, there's been a recent upswing in guerilla theaters sprouting up around the US. The <a href=\"http://www.guerilladrivein.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Santa Cruz version</a> is currently the best known, but <a href=\"http://www.mobmov.org/default.php?intro=done\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">MobMov</a>'s are popping up all over the place. This Saturday's MaGG could also be considered a \"guerilla drive-in,\" only it's 100% legal... and much cooler.\r\n\r\nMaybe one day we'll be able to upgrade MaGG to something like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/061306/mob01.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/061306/mob01a.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hi-arts.co.uk/screen_machine2_gallery.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">more pics</a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/061306/mob02.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/061306/mob02a.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cinetransformer.com.mx/fotosunidad-en.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">more pics</a>\r\n\r\nWe could take Moxie movies all over Missouri! Ah, to be a millionaire.... Who wants to invest?! How sad is it that the second mobile cinema has more seats than our very un-mobile cinema... *sigh*",

Unfortunately, it's not eligible since it came out last year, right? \r\n\r\nThat soundtrack demands an award too.",

It looks like the <i>perfect</i> role for Scarlett. It might even bring her some award nominations??",
