  "body": "The July calendar is up! Pretty sweet, eh? Not only are we celebrating POINT BREAK's 15th anniversary in July, but we're also kicking off the month with THE MOXIE PASSPORT SERIES. Here's how it works:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>During the first week of July, pick up your official Moxie Passport at the Cinebar (see the mock-up below).</li>\r\n<li>We have SEVEN international films in July, and when you come watch one we'll put a stamp on the corresponding number in your passport.</li>\r\n<li>At the end of the month, the people with the most stamps will have their passports put into a container of some sort (most likely a bowl), and a winner will be drawn at random.</li></ol>\r\nAnd what, pray tell, does the winner <i>win</i>? A <b>$400 travel gift certificate</b> that they can use on any expense through Great Southern Travel (i.e. plane tickets, hotel stays, cruise, whatever). So throughout the month of July you'll be able to travel the world without ever leaving Springfield, then, if you come see our awesome movies, you'll have a chance to do some real travelling of your own!\r\n\r\nHere's what the Moxie Passport looks like:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/062706/passport1.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/062706/passport2.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nIt folds up to business card size, just like our M.U.M.P.S. card. Don't forget to pick yours up during the first week of July!",
