We once again have 75 comfortable vintage chairs. However, the process they used to fix the chairs can't be done more than once or twice, so as the chairs continue to break down, which they will, it will eventually get to a point where they'll need to be replaced... but let's not dwell on the negative. For now, we have a comfortable auditorium with 75 great little chairs.\r\n\r\nSo next time you sit in a comfortable chair, whether it be here or somewhere else, say a silent thanks to my dad, and uncles Larry and Sonny. Woo hoo!",
