We're co-presenting THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW with the Landers Theatre... at their place, of course. It's going to be a blast! The Landers is selling ROCKY HORROR prop kits with rice and newspaper and all the other stuff that people toss around during a typical screening. I've never even seen RHPS, but I can easily say it's been the single most requested movie for us to play.<br/><br/>I'm just glad I'm not on the cleaning staff... woo hoo!",
