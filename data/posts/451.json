  "body": "Tomorrow (Thursday) will mark our one year anniversary. It's been a crazy, hectic, and fun 52nd week of operation. I don't think we'll ever cram in this many events into such a short amount of time. My kidneys feel like they're going to explode from all the stress I've internalized. I also barfed this morning... chocolate milk. I won't go into the details though. Where was I? Oh yeah, tomorrow is the big day. Woo hoo!\r\n\r\nOur birthday concert will start at 9:15-ish, and tickets are FREE. You can pick them up anytime tomorrow prior to the show. The lineup is: Cindy Woolf, JR Top (Sweetwater Abilene), and Nathaniel Carroll. Cupcakes will also be free, until they run out. Also, it looks like the Cinebar naming rights are going to go for a lot less this year than they did last year (barring a flurry of last minute bidding tomorrow afternoon). If it doesn't go over $500, all the money will be donated to MSU and Drury, and we'll just have to keep saving for a new neon sign.\r\n\r\nI'm tired and worn down. Bedtime can't come soon enough. Oh! It's here! We'll see you guys tomorrow night!",
