  "body": "We just found out tonight (Monday) that Jeff Smith, the subject of <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/films/130\" class=\"broken\">CAN MR. SMITH GET TO WASHINGTON ANYMORE?</a> will be here for tomorrow (Tuesday) night's showing. If you want to come see this movie, which I highly recommend, tomorrow night would be an especially good time to do so since you get to meet the actual person the movie is about! How many times have you got to do that... not counting that time Big Smith played after the showing of HOMEMADE HILLBILLY JAM? It's a rare occurence that we're trying to make less so.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and stop by tomorrow night at 7:00 (or earlier if you want to make sure you get tickets). See a good movie, meet an interesting guy, buy some cold beer, eat some delicious popcorn, marvel at my full and vibrant beard. Good time - guaranteed.",
