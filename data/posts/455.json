The first one will run in front of THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP, which opens tonight... and guess what?! HERE IT IS RIGHT HERE FOR ALL TO SEE!!!!!!1\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YbYtkjeGWSc\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YbYtkjeGWSc\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nIt looks a lot better on the big screen - you can actually read the scrolling text without getting a headache. The big question is this: how long will it be before George Lucas sues us into the ground? Either way, enjoy it while you can.\r\n\r\n<b>UPDATE:</b> I forgot to mention this earlier, but the intro may one day evolve into the \"Little Superstar\" clip, which I watch at least 18 times a day.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/gx-NLPH8JeM\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/gx-NLPH8JeM\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nI'm still working on my slow motion dance walk.",

It can only get better from here.\r\n\r\nI'm going to have a nightmare about that other clip tonight though. Hilarious yes, but also freakishly disturbing. ",
