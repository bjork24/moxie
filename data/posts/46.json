Do you remember the little \"side note\" in the <a href=\"38\">mid-July update</a> about my neighbor who is currently being investigated by the feds? Well, here's a nice little <a href=\"http://www.sos.mo.gov/news.asp?id=364\" target=\"_blank\">article about her</a> from the office of Missouri's Secretary of State. Pretty cool, eh?<br/><br/>We ran into her yesterday as we were coming home from work. Nicole said \"hello\" out of rote politeness, and our neighbor rolled her eyes. She's a real winner.",
