However, I've known people who have forgotten before... so consider this a gentle reminder. Also, if you come into The Moxie tonight with your \"I Voted\" sticker, OR your voter registration card, we'll give you the discounted matinee price.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to do your part, and remember to vote \"NO\" on the Springfield bar ban (hint: it's the last question on the ballot). Good luck!",
