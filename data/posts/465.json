And here they are:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Blindsight</li>\r\n<li>Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore?</li>\r\n<li>Deliver Us from Evil</li>\r\n<li>The Ground Truth</li>\r\n<li>An Inconvenient Truth</li>\r\n<li>Iraq in Fragments</li>\r\n<li>Jesus Camp</li>\r\n<li>Jonestown: The Life and Death of People’s Temple</li>\r\n<li>My Country, My Country</li>\r\n<li>Shut Up & Sing</li>\r\n<li>Sisters in Law</li>\r\n<li>Storm of Emotions</li>\r\n<li>The Trials of Darryl Hunt</li>\r\n<li>An Unreasonable Man</li>\r\n<li>The War Tapes</li></ul>\r\nWe've already shown four from that list, and several more are on the way. It's a shame that CAN MR SMITH GET TO WASHINGTON ANYMORE? didn't bring in more people, especially when we had both the director and subject of the film come by to talk. Live and learn, I guess... that's right, I'm talking to YOU, Mr./Mrs./Ms. I-was-too-busy-to-come-see-that-one!",

The film follows the campaign of Jeff Smith, a professor from Washington University in St. Louis, and his battle for Dick Gephardtâ€™s seat as Missouriâ€™s U.S. Representative. His opponent, Russ Carnahan, hails from the dynastic Carnahan family and holds a 40 point lead over his no-name challenger. Even with the odds stacked against him, Smith rushes forward with a no-budget, grassroots campaign and creates one of the most compelling and exciting political documentaies in recent years. WINNER of the Audience Award at the 2006 Silverdocs Film Festival.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat part sounds Republican to you, RJ? The no-budget, grassroots campaign part, or the David vs. Goliath part?",
