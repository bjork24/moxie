The sun is shining, the ice is melting, and gift certificates and bulk passes are now <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/gifts\" class=\"broken\">available online</a>. FINALLY! Don't let the treacherous driving conditions keep you from purchasing what The New York Times has called \"The Best Holiday Gift of All-Time*\"... be safe, and buy your gift certificates and bulk passes online!!! I even set it up where people can buy online and have the certificates and passes mailed where ever they like! FANTASTIC!\r\n\r\n<small>* total lie</small>\r\n\r\nIn other news, it's been pretty slow around these parts. The three feet of snow and ice have kept our attendance numbers low this weekend, but we're hoping to bounce back up with FUR and JESUS CAMP, both of which are seeing a steady amount of advance ticket purchases. Go second week of December, GO!\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget about our special two-day showing of MY BOSS IS AN IDIOT, the latest local film from Nate Black and Brandon Goodwin. Last December Nate and Brandon debuted their first feature length film, A PIANO BY CHRISTMAS, at The Moxie and both shows sold out. So, a word to the wise: buy your tickets early! And if you have no idea what I'm talking about, check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faddny0togo\" target=\"_blank\">their preview for the film</a>.\r\n\r\nSee what I mean? Buy your tickets <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/tickets\" class=\"broken\">now</a>, or come by anytime and pick them up at the theater.\r\n",
