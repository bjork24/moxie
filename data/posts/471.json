  "title": "Moxie Shirt 2007",
  "body": "Over the last year and a half, we've heard a lot of requests from our customers. \"You need chairs that aren't broken!\" New chairs are being installed on the 20th and 21st. \"I can't find your building!\" A big neon sign will be going up in the next few months. \"When are you getting new shirts?\" Well, after nearly a year and a half, I'm happy to announce that the new Moxie shirts will be available one week from tomorrow (Friday, December 15th). Just in time for the holidays! WOO HOO! So, without further ado, here's the new Moxie shirt for 2007:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120706/front_and_back.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>In case you don't have super vision, here's a close up of the front:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120706/front.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>and the back:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120706/back.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Now, you're probably thinking to yourself, \"what the hell?!\" Let me explain. Back when we first opened, one of regular customers took a shirt and created the first Moxie Tally Shirt. After each movie he saw here, he'd make a mark on the front, and write the name of the film on the back. Nearly one year and three months later, his shirt is almost completely full, and it looks really cool. His shirt was the inspiration for our newest design. Feel free to fill in the box on the back however you like. You can put hatch mark, stars, little popcorn kernels... whatever you want to use to denote how many films you've seen at The Moxie.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120706/back_hatch.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Or, if you don't get a chance to see many movies here, you can go the other direction and fill up space by writing out the titles.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120706/back_words.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>If you don't feel like writing on your shirt at all, you can always use the box on the back to screen your own independent movies. After all, our screen isn't much bigger than the box on an XL shirt.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/120706/back_bjork.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>So, there it is: Moxie Shirt 2007. Each one has the potential to be completely different than all the rest, which is why I think they're super, SUPER cool. We're selling them for $18 each, or $20 if you want a shirt AND a sharpie (for which to make your marks with). Again, they'll be ready to pick up next Friday, but I'm sure if you flash us a friendly smile, we'd be happy to sell you one in advance. Ok, it's time to open. WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!<br/>",
