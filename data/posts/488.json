  "body": "Permits have been filed, insurance has been secured, signatures have been signed, and now the only thing standing between us and our new Moxie sign is time. Payne Sign Company, the fine folks who built our flashy new neon marquee, have our install scheduled for 9:00 am on Wednesday... dependent on weather. If the skies are clear, the sign raising shall commence! So, if you're in the neighborhood between 9:00 am and noon, you should swing by and check out the progress. I know a few of you wanted to take pictures, so by all means... feel free. I have no idea how long it takes to install a sign like this, but I'm guessing three hours is more than enough time.<br/><br/>Here are a couple pictures I took earlier this month to help whet your appetite:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/032607/side.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/><img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/032607/front.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>The \"CINEMA\" side will cover the opening you see in the second picture, and will face Walnut Street. The \"CINEMA\" side isn't lit up, but the paint they used has super reflectivity, so it almost looks like it is. The \"MOXIE\" side is the same on both the East and West side, and will be lit up with red neon at night. It will flash M / MO / MOX / MOXI / MOXIE / MOXIE / MOXIE, and then start back over. My hope is that you'll be able to see the sign all the way from South and Walnut, but the big furniture sign on the Thompson Brothers building might block it. Either way, we're super excited.<br/><br/><b style=\"color:#F00;\">AND DON'T FORGET - FRIDAY NIGHT - THE GILLIOZ - MOXIE / GILLIOZ FUNDRAISER - FREE - FREE - FREE</b><br/><br/>This event is a huge watershed moment for The Moxie, and it would mean a lot to us if all of you were able to make it. Not only will you be turning out in support of your favorite little theater, which is hopefully us, but you'll also get a free chance to see the newly restored Gillioz, and catch a nice documentary to boot. I'm not sure if I mentioned this before, but the filmmakers will be in attendance, and they'll be filming parts of the event to include in the special features of their DVD. All in all, it's going to be a historic night - for us, for the Gillioz, for downtown, and hopefully for you too. Of course, it's up to you to figure out why it will be historic for you. Maybe you'll find a $20 bill in the parking lot or something... I don't know.",

Not 15 minutes later, there is a loud bang in the vacinity of our building which is up the hill from the main plant, and I soon notice that the electricity is out...<br/><br/>For the past couple of days, there had been earth movers recontouring the lot next to our area, and as it turns out, they snagged the main power cable running up to our building, perhaps blowing a transformer in the process (the bang). We all spend the next 45 minutes or so, wondering what this means. Then 7 minutes before I leave for the day, a plant superintendent comes up to me and asks \"Do you want the day off tomorrow...?\"<br/><br/>I'll be there, Dan...",
