  "title": "Prizes for the Ozarks Regional Air Guitar Championship",
  "body": "We're nearly one week away from the preliminaries for the very first Ozarks Regional AIR GUITAR Championship, and I am PUMPED! We've received a ton of positive comments about the event, and I have a feeling we're going to have a decent turnout at the Outland next Wednesday night. My biggest worry, however, is that plenty of people will show up to WATCH, but not many will want to show off their sweet AIR GUITAR skillz. So, I'm asking for some assistance from you guys - tell everyone you know who might be the least bit interested in rocking out on stage to show up Wednesday night. We only need FIVE people to move on to the finals, so we're looking for AT LEAST 10 to 15 participants.<br/><br/>I'm going to let you in on a little secret too... well, it's not really a <i>secret</i> secret, since I'm hoping you'll use this info to lure people to the preliminaries, but you get the idea. The winner of this year's event is going to win a LOT of cool stuff. We haven't announced the prizes on OzarksAirGuitar.com yet, but I'm going to give you guys an exclusive scoop on what the first annual Ozarks Regional Air Guitar Champion will take home with him or her:<br/><br/><ol><li>The champion will win a REAL guitar from Springfield Music, along with a year's worth of free guitar lessons.</li><br/><li>The winner will get to perform as an opening act during Q102's ROCKFEST.</li><br/><li>This hasn't been 100% confirmed yet, but we're pretty sure we'll be able to send the winner to Dallas (expenses paid), so they can compete for a chance to qualify for the WORLD AIR GUITAR CHAMPIONSHIP!</li><br/><li>There's also a very, very strong chance that the winner will take home some cold hard cash... the amount will be determined before they perform on June 2nd.</li><br/><li>They'll also win... are you ready for this?... a free Moxie t-shirt!!!! OMG!,</li></ol><br/>So there you have it. Run, go tell your friends, spread the word, and make sure you show up next Wednesday night for what will surely be one of the coolest, most unique events to hit Springfield in a long, long time. ROCK ON SPRINGFIELD!<br/>",
