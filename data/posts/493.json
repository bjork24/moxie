  "body": "Nicole and I are leaving on our first official vacation tomorrow: a week-long cruise with the Chilton family. It ought to be a blast as long as we don't get rained on. It marks the longest we've been away from The Moxie.... EVER! I guess it's long over-due though. Our trusty employees are going to be running the ship while we're away, so make sure you stop in and give them a hard time... just to make sure we're getting our money's worth... NOT! Seriously though, don't bother them. I'll hunt you down and do strange things to your car.<br/><br/>We'll be back next Friday - sunburned, bloated, and fully rested - just in time for the kick-off of David Lynch's INLAND EMPIRE. We're also having a short documentary made about the Moxie that weekend, so the fun will NEVER stop! Ok, I'm excited for our break. It's the first cruise for everyone involved, so I'm sure we'll have a handful of faux pas to share on our return. I feel giddy at the thought of it!!! See you soon!",
