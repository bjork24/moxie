  "body": "Today's post won't be very long. I've spent the last 4 days explaining the background behind our project, so that should hopefully add some context for future posts. Today marks the beginning of summer, and I have every intention of spending this three-day weekend (Memorial Day weekend) writing, revising, editing, and completing our business plan.<br/><br/>This blog, by the way, is just a way for me to chronicle the steps Nicole and I are taking to make Cinema 24 a reality. It's not targeted towards anyone in particular, but if you find yourself in the same boat as us, hopefully this blog will shed a little light on the frighteningly enjoyable process of starting your own theater.<br/><br/>If all goes well (investors are found, finances are secured, leases are signed), I'll divulge the real names of the theater, the town, etc.. Until those milestones are crossed, Cinema 24 will remain cloaked in anonymity, because I'd hate for a wayward Midwestburg businessman (or woman), with more money than brains, happen upon this blog and steal our idea just to turn a quick buck.... psh, good luck!<br/><br/>We'd be lucky to turn any bucks as is, but more on that later.",
