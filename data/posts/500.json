  "body": "<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/071007/movie-ranks.jpg\" width=\"425\" /><br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new Moxie record holder. After a two week run, CHALK has replaced AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE as our new #1 movie. The easiest way I've found to compare movies to each other is by tallying the Average People Per Show (APPS). Using this metric, I can compare a movie that only showed for one week against one that showed for five or more.<br/><br/>After AQUA TEEN, we thought it would be quite a while before we had a new all-time leader, but less than a month later CHALK has proven us wrong. What's even more crazy is that the 59 APPS only factors the screenings we had here at The Moxie. If you add in the attendance from our screening at The Landers, CHALK's APPS jumps to 77! That's more people than our theater will even hold!<br/><br/>The reason I included PAN'S LABYRINTH way down at #4 is because it still holds the record for the most shows, most tickets sold, biggest box office, and longest run (five weeks). When you show a movie as many times as we did PAN'S, and you <i>still</i> end up with an APPS that high... well, that's just damn impressive.<br/><br/>I hate to see CHALK go, but such is the ebb and flow of the single-screen calendar house. It's always depressing when you bid farewell to a movie that does huge amounts of business. ONCE is holding its own, which is good, but it's no CHALK. I wonder what the next #1 movie will be? We used to think nothing would top AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, and yet nine months later here comes AQUA TEEN, and then CHALK. It's hard to imagine a movie being able to fill over 3/4 of our auditorium for every single show, but anything's possible. Anything you set your mind to can be achieved. Anything at all.<br/><br/>And now I'm off to the bathroom.",

When I showed up a few minutes late to the Landers screening, you were in the lobby by the box office, loudly proclaiming that it was \"the worst thing you'd ever seen.  The <em>worst!\"</em><br/>I think you were asking for your money back, though I'm not certain.  Please note that this was only 5-10 minutes into the film, not the ideal length of time to adequately gauge whether something is, in fact, the worst thing you have ever seen.  Also?  There were a couple people standing around, looking at you oddly, whom I fear might have been the filmmakers themselves, or at least their family members.  You, of course, were oblivious to their presence, as you are oblivious to many things.<br/>I tried to bring you down gently, saying something like, \"Now, now RJ, it couldn't have been that bad,\" with a sort of nervous chuckle and look towards the box office people, and using some sort of moxie forum-ish camaraderie to bring you back into the fold and perhaps the auditorium, but you only got louder... and I gave up after about 5 seconds.",

You thought I killed myself from the people walking out early on! You fools! Continue the show!\" and give the audience the finger.

      "body": "People should never ask a theater for their money back, unless there has been some sort of glitch that's kept them from actually watching the movie.  It's not like the theater made the movie or anything, they're just doing you a favor by showing it.  The purpose of <em>going to see a movie</em> is to either enjoy it, or not.  It's entertainment.  There are no do-overs; you either like it and are happy, or you don't like it and move on to the next one.  All of this can be done without marching through a lobby and letting anyone within an earshot know how much you thought a particular film sucked.  <br/><br/>Chances are they don't care.  Really.<br/><br/>When you go to a restaurant, you may complain to the waiter that your steak isn't well-done like you ordered, but you'd be wrong to assume that it is, in fact, his fault, and not the fault of the person who actually prepared the food.  The waiter just delivers the item to you.  Do they deserve the barrage of complaints?  Of course not.  Do the other patrons of the restaurant deserve the barrage of complaints?  No.  By voicing your opinion to anyone who will pretend to not be listening, you come off looking like a  starved-for-attention ass.  <br/><br/>Think about it.  Which sounds better? <br/><br/>\"Hello, waiter sir, but I believe my steak is a little under-cooked.  Would it be a problem to cook it a bit longer?  Thanks.\" <br/>-- or -- <br/>\"WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE.  THIS FUCKING STEAK, MAN. UN-DER-COOKED.  WHAT KIND OF FUCKING WAITER ARE YOU?  THIS RESTAURANT IS A REAL PIECE OF SHIT. I WANT MY MONEY BACK.\"<br/><br/>Now let's bring it back full-circle, and apply it to theaters. Which sounds better?<br/><br/>(To friends) \"Man, that movie sucked.  Here's why...\"<br/>-- or --<br/>(To anyone within an earshot) \"WHAT THE FUCK. THAT WORST MOVIE EVER EVEN THOUGH I ONLY WATCHED 5 MINUTES OF IT.  TRUST ME, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE.

It is a marketing strategy for interested people to learn about the film being shown, and something about the personality of the owners and their theatre.  I think it is hugely disrespectful to The Moxie, Dan and Nicole, and potential paying customers that comments made on the owner's blog contain profanity or any other language that may dissuade interested persons from learning more about this outstanding business.    <br/><br/>I apologize if I am speaking out of turn or hurt feelings, but I know that they work incredibly hard and value every filmgoer who visits their theatre and this portion of their website.  They are very dedicated business people in a very serious business.  I care about what the Chiltons are trying to pull off.  Realizing that there is also a very vast and popular forum where people can fully exercise their free speech as freely as free speech can possibly meander, I think Dan and Nicole's much more accessible and much more mainstream <strong>blog portion </strong>should aspire to a higher standard  when comments are made.  In other words, if it is offensive to throw f-bomb laden tirades in the entryway of a theatre, it is probably equally offensive to do so at the entryway of a website.  Again, congrats.",

I really enjoyed it and I think it's awesome that the moxie (my absolute fav. movie theatre/popcorn vendor/hip hangout) had such great success with it.  <br/><br/>Secondly, I guess I sort of agree with evilvet though I think that's what the forum disclaimer is for.  I try to keep my language pretty PG on the forums in general mostly because I think that online words can be very easily misconstrued.  I can understand and am unoffended by most forumers word choices because a lot of us do know each other \"IRL\" and already have a rapport established.  <br/>I do think that we should maybe keep our more personal rants, tirades, jokes, and language choices on boards outside the blog or movie review categories, as these are the threads most likely to be viewed by guests.<br/><br/>Wait, I can't agree with my parents...

And since The Moxie Cinema was recently chosen as a finalist as Best Entrepreneur for Springfield Business Journalâ€™s 2007 Economic Impact Awards, I trust they know what they're doing.  I don't think it would take a high priced consultant to tell them what we already know.  That the movie review posts and the front page blogs penned by the owner reach and are designed to reach a different audience than those found in the forum section.  The point of Dan's above blog entry is that this was a record month for The Moxie.  I don't think that Chalk is necessarily a better movie than An Inconvenient Truth or Pan's Labyrinth.  I believe it is because The Moxie is succeeding in reaching a wider audience, and their business plan is succeeding.  That growth will continue, and I wager the growth will be faster if the posts for the <strong>front page owner blog </strong>and <strong>movie reviews </strong>are a smidge more enlightened and educational, and reserve the free form  stuff for the forum.
