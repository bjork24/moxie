  "body": "<img src=\"http://moxie.danchilton.com/pix/grum/081507/summer.jpg\" width=\"425\" />\r\n\r\nIt might not feel like it outside, but Summer is finally drawing to a close. For us, Summer ends when college students roll back into town, which is going on as you read this. Monday marks the beginning of the 2007-2008 school year, and we couldn't be happier. <b>WELCOME BACK STUDENTS!</b>\r\n\r\nSummers are typically slower for small indie theater like the Moxie, not only because students are gone, but because the multiplexes are filled with a-list blockbusters, and the warmer weather lures people into doing stuff that usually doesn't include seeing a movie (i.e. camping, swimming, going on vacation). We were well aware of this when last Summer (our first) rolled around, but it didn't end up being nearly as bad as we were expecting. Summer 2006 was a smidgen below average, but none of the four months landed in our bottom five. In fact, last August was one of our biggest months on record.\r\n\r\nSo far this year, we've outpaced last Summer in May, June, and July, and with RESCUE DAWN, SICKO, and THE TEN coming up in August, it looks like we might just beat that month too! Summer 2007 has been better than 2006, and that's a very good thing. And that's really all I had to say. I'm just a wee bit excited.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, our lamphouse wimped out on us today, forcing us to cancel our 4:15 show at the last minute. Luckily I isolated the problem quickly (broken momentary switch on the manual strike button), and had everything up and running again by 5:00. That's the third time we've had to cancel a show when people were already in the auditorium. Three misfires out of 1,984 shows. I'm not sure what that works out to percentage-wise, but despite how low it might be, I'd still rather have it at 0%. Damn projector!\r\n\r\nAnd for those of you who are curious, our 2,000th show will be the 9:00 pm TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE this Sunday. AWESOME! And next Wednesday will also be our 700th day of operation. DOUBLE AWESOME!",

It's like people were already primed to misread things.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anybody will get mad at Derek ^there^ for doing the same thing.  He's also told people to \"Go fuck themselves\", and the day is still young.  You'd have to be blind to know he's not joking, but people were plenty blind before.\r\n\r\nGah.  Still pisses me off.\r\n\r\nOkay, I'm dropping it.",
