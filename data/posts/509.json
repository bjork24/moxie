  "title": "The \"Most Movies at The Moxie\" Award",
  "body": "<img src=\"http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/4530/collagepz2.jpg\">\r\n\r\nHere at The Moxie we like to keep a running tally on which actor or actress has appeared in the most Moxie movies. We thought maybe one day we'd create an actual trophy, and the winner of this illustrious award would be so excited that they're the pinnacle of indie acting in Springfield, that they would rush from Hollywood or New York or Ireland or wherever, and claim their prize. We'd hang out and reminisce about the good ol' days when we showed their films, and then when they won their next Independent Spirit Award, Golden Globe or Oscar, guess who would be the first mentioned? That's right. The Moxie. \r\n\r\nWe can dream, right?\r\n\r\nSo, after two years of showing films, here's how it stacks up so far:\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR FILM CLUB:\r\n<ul><li><b>Zach Stephens</b> with FOUR films (all local)! DUCK DUCK GOOSE, THE DRAWING ROOM DEBACLE, DEATH HAIR, and THE LAST ROMANTIC. This kid is going to go places, I tell you.</li>\r\n<li>And technically, Daniel Auteuil with THE CLOSET, CACHE, THE VALET, and MY BEST FRIEND, but one was a Moxie-A-Go-Go Event, so we're not sure if we've decided that counts yet or not. What do you think?</li></ul>\r\nThe THREE TIMERS include:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><b>Hope Davis</b>: Duma, The Matador, Proof</li>\r\n<li><b>Juliet Binoche</b>: Cache, Paris Je T'aime, Breaking and Entering</li>\r\n<li><b>Judie Dench</b>: Mrs. Henderson Presents, Notes on a Scandal, Ladies in Lavendar</li>\r\n<li><b>Laura Dern</b>: Inland Empire, Happy Endings, Year of the Dog</li>\r\n<li><b>Patrick Wilson</b>: Hard Candy, Little Children, Running with Scissors</li>\r\n<li><b>Daniel Auteuil</b>: The Closet (shown at a Moxie-a-Go-Go event)*, Cache, The Valet, My Best Friend</li>\r\n<li><b>Evan Rachel Wood</b>: Down in the Valley, Running with Scissors, King of California</li></ul>\r\nAnd a plethora of actors have appeared in two, including (but in no particular order):\r\n\r\n<ul><li><b>Cillian Murphy</b> (sigh): Breakfast on Pluto, The Wind that Shakes the Barley</li>\r\n<li><b>Gerard Depardieu</b>: The Closet (shown at Moxie-A-Go-Go Event)*, Paris Je T'aime, La Vie en Rose; he also directed a segment in Paris Je T'aime</li>\r\n<li><b>Margot Martindale</b>: Rocket Science, Paris Je T'aime</li>\r\n<li><b>Elijah Wood</b>: Everything is Illuminated, Paris Je T'aime</li>\r\n<li><b>Maggie Gyllenhaal</b>: Happy Endings, Paris Je T'aime</li>\r\n<li><b>Lieve Schrieber</b>: The Ten, The Painted Veil</li>\r\n<li><b>Edward Norton</b>: The Painted Veil, Down in the Valley</li>\r\n<li><b>Steve Buscemi</b>: Paris Je T'aime, Interview</li>\r\n<li><b>Miranda Richardson</b>: Paris Je T'aime, The Wah-Wah</li>\r\n<li><b>Bob Hoskins</b>: Paris Je T'aime, Mrs. Henderson Presents</li>\r\n<li><b>Emily Watson</b>: Wah-Wah, The Proposition</li>\r\n<li><b>Martin Freeman</b>: Breaking and Entering, Confetti</li>\r\n<li><b>Ray Winstone</b>: The Proposition, Breaking and Entering</li>\r\n<li><b>Richard Griffiths</b>: Venus, The History Boys, Harry Potter* (special event)</li>\r\n<li><b>Steve Coogan</b>: Tristram Shandy, Happy Endings</li>\r\n<li><b>Gillian Anderson</b>: Tristram Shandy, The Last King of Scotland</li>\r\n<li><b>Robert Downey, Jr.</b>: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Fur</li>\r\n<li><b>Ty Burrell</b>: Fur, Down in the Valley</li>\r\n<li><b>Joseph Cross</b>: Strangers with Candy, Running with Scissors</li>\r\n<li><b>Gwyneth Paltrow</b>: Proof, Running with Scissors</li>\r\n<li><b>Guillermo Toledo</b>: The Perfect Crime, Only Human</li></ul>\r\nOnly time will tell who will break out of the THREE TIMER CLUB, and into the four (or even five!) film realm. That Evan Rachel Woods looks like she might take the lead, since she's so young and seems to be the go-to girl of choice right now, but my bet is on Dame Judi Dench. She's got spunk.",

In typical Daniel Auteuil fashion, he plays a successful artist, weary of Parisian life and on the verge of divorce. Of course, my biggest reason for wanting to see it is because Ã‰lodie Navarre is in it :-)",
