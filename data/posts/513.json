  "body": "How is it that November is only a few days away? We've been so caught up planning <a href=\"http://www.rhpsmo.com\" class=\"broken\">ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW</a> that we've lost track of time. So, without further ado, here's a quick snapshot of the weeks to come:<br/><br/><b>KURT COBAIN ABOUT A SON</b> starts on Friday, November 2 and runs through Tuesday, November 6. <b>Kurt Cobain About a Son</b> is an intimate and moving meditation on the late musician and artist Kurt Cobain, based on more than 25 hours of previously unheard audiotaped interviews conducted with Cobain by noted music journalist Michael Azerrad for his book <i>Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana</i>. In the film, Kurt Cobain recounts his own life - from his childhood and adolescence to his days of musical discovery and later dealings with explosive fame - and offers often piercing insights into his life, music, and times. The conversations heard in the film have never before been made public and they reveal a highly personal portrait of an artist much discussed but not particularly well understood.<br/><br/>Director AJ Schnack will be in attendance at The Moxie for a Q&A on Sunday, November 4. Showtimes that evening are 7:00 pm and 9:15 pm. Get your ticket early, because we anticipate big crowds! Online tickets will be available starting on Monday 10/29.<br/><br/>Also opening on Friday is the highly anticipated <b>THE 11TH HOUR</b>, which is Leo DiCaprio's new on doc on global warming. This film kicks off a month-long theme of \"nature fighting back\" along with THE LAST WINTER and INTO THE WILD. <br/><br/>We should have our print calendars and online schedule available late Monday afternoon. Dan is furiously pecking away on his computer trying to get everything finished (at least, I think that's what he's working on...I hear a lot of giggling, so he may just be looking at pictures of his Where's Waldo costume).<br/><br/><img src=\"http://img86.imageshack.us/img86/2356/waldokh1.jpg\"><br/><br/>Anyways. To satisfy your thirst of all things Moxie, we present you with a timetable of upcoming films:<br/><br/><b><a href=\"http://www.kurtcobainaboutason.com/\" class=\"broken\">Kurt Cobain About A Son</a></b>: Nov. 2 - 6<br/><b><a href=\"http://wip.warnerbros.com/11thhour/\" class=\"broken\">The 11th Hour</a></b>: Nov. 2 - 13<br/><b><a href=\"http://ifcfilms.com/viewFilm.htm?filmId=411\" class=\"broken\">I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With</a></b>: Nov. 7 - 13<br/><b><a href=\"http://www.thelastwinter.net/\" class=\"broken\">The Last Winter</a></b>: Nov. 14 - 20<br/><b><a href=\"http://www.intothewild.com/\" class=\"broken\">Into The Wild</a></b>: Nov. 14 - 20<br/><b><a href=\"http://www.moxieshorts.com\" class=\"broken\">Moxie Shorts</a></b>: Nov. 16 - 18<br/><b><a href=\"http://www.larsandtherealgirl-themovie.com/\" class=\"broken\">Lars and the Real Girl</a></b>: Nov. 21 - TBA<br/><b><a href=\"http://www.greatworldofsound.com/\" class=\"broken\">Great World of Sound</a></b>: Nov. 23 - 25<br/><b><a href=\"http://www.sonyclassics.com/sleuth/\" class=\"broken\">Sleuth</a></b>: Nov. 28 - TBA<br/><br/>And if you need more Halloween goodness, I leave you with a picture of Meat Head, the snackable centerpiece we created. Because who doesn't want to peel meat off a skull? Sorry, you won't find this at The Cinebar.<br/><br/><img src=\"http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/465/meatheadgx3.jpg\"><br/>",
