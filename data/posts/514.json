  "body": "The Wall Street Journal recently wrote a story about the Oscar-qualifying process that documentaries went through this year. It shook up filmmakers and the Academy, and had the film world (especially independent filmmakers and cinema owners) buzzing for months. The effect of this year's process is still undetermined, but it's been interesting to watch, and to be a participant (of the dozen or so we showed, Meeting Resistance, About a Son, Billy the Kid, The Business of Being Born were just a few of these films). If you're a documentary fan, or are intrigued by the behind-the-scenes exhibition world, then this article is for you. And, oh yeah, we're mentioned in it, too.\r\n\r\nThe article is only available free today, and then you have to pay to read it (unless you're already a savvy news reader and subscribe to the WSJ). <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119457332563887440.html\">Click here for the link.</a>\r\n\r\nOh, and what movie is playing on our marquee in that picture? It seems like an awfully long title. Why, I think it says, \"The Moxie is the Coolest Theater in Springfield. Hands Down.\" Well shucks, marquee. \r\n\r\n*Thanks for Steve Croxton's photographic expertise, and Matt and Kari at <a href=\"http://www.springfieldgo.com\" class=\"broken\">Go Magazine</a> for digging up the file photo for the story.\r\n\r\n",
