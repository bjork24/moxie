Our new 2008 t-shirts* are in stock!\r\n2. LABYRINTH is this weekend†, and tickets are flying out the door!\r\n\r\n* This year's shirts are super awesome for several reasons: they're printed on 100% cotton American Apparel shirts (the best fitting shirts in the world), they're going for the low, low price of $15 a pop, and they're guaranteed** to make you look 20 pounds lighter!\r\n\r\n** Not really, but I hear black is a slimming color.\r\n\r\n† Anticipating large crowds, we scheduled FOUR showings over the span of this coming weekend. We have a couple late shows on Friday and Saturday, but also some earlier shows on Sunday for those of you who might not want to stay out late to see one of the greatest movies of all time. In fact, Sunday's noon show is a perfect opportunity to introduce younger film-goers to this contemporary classic, as well as getting them addicted to The Moxie (gotta start 'em young!). No matter which showtime you choose, make sure you <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/tickets\" class=\"broken\">buy your tickets in advance</a>! Seriously.\r\n\r\n†† And for all you Ludo fans out there, sorry I had to cover him up with our awesome shirt. It was a choice between hiding him, or obscuring the super cute (and criminally young) Jennifer Connelly. I think I made the right decision. (Ludo SAD!)",
