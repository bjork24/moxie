Well, that's not the case anymore. We recently secured THE ORPHANAGE, a brand new Spanish horror film presented by Guillermo del Toro. Nicole used a great picture on <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/films/285\" class=\"broken\">our official page</a>, but check out the one above... CREEPY! And I dug up a high quality version of the new trailer, which is 1,000,000 times better than the crappy one on Apple's website. Enjoy!<br/><br/><object width=\"425\" height=\"339\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.movieweb.com/v/V07K48ewyzGJLY\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.movieweb.com/v/V07K48ewyzGJLY\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"339\"></embed></object><br/><br/>THE ORPHANAGE starts on January 30th.",
