  "body": "Due to overwhelming customer demand, and a nice call from the film studio, we've decided to hold on to I'M NOT THERE for another two weeks. Tonight's 9:30 show was supposed to be the last, but that's no longer the case. The showtimes for I'M NOT THERE will be a little wonky for the next week, due to increased shows for THE SAVAGES, but should return to normal on the 30th.\r\n\r\nAn hour after we confirmed this, we heard that Heath Ledger had died, which made for a very macabre coincidence. Heath is one of six actors who portray Bob Dylan in the film. Cate Blanchett was nominated for Best Supporting Actress this morning for her portrayal of Dylan.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check out <a href=\"/posts/529\">our annual Oscar post</a>, which we published earlier today.",
