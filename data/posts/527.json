  "body": "As of right now, our website is the #1 search result on google for the word \"<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=moxie\">moxie</a>.\" That's pretty impressive considering there are over 3.3 million other results for the same word, and yet there we are... king of the google mountain. Our little website even trumps wikipedia's entry for Moxie soda! Who knows how long we'll stay on top, but being the internet nerd I am, I'm awfully proud.\r\n\r\nThis must be what it feels like to be a parent and watch your kid do something really, really awesome... like that time I fell out of a treehouse while my mom was watching. Awesome.\r\n\r\n<b>UPDATE:</b> We just dropped back to #3. I guess I better cancel this weekend's congratulatory cocaine-fueled parties. Fame is a fickle mistress, indeed.\r\n\r\n<b>UPDATE:</b> Now we're at #2! Obviously Google is trying to play with my mind. It may have worked once, Larry, but never again! Do you hear me?! NEVER AGAIN!",
