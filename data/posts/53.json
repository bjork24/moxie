  "body": "<b>Blog Redesign</b>\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already noticed, the blog had an extreme makeover yesterday. The new design is what will be used on <b>the Moxie's</b> website, so I thought I'd give it a test run on the blog before I the big reveal. The design is 100% CSS-P, which means very little to a great many of you. I'm too lazy to change all the ancillary pages, which, by the way, have all moved to the top of the page. Also, the comments link has moved to the top of the post, instead of down at the bottom. That's about it. As always, please let me know if you find any browser-specific bugs.\r\n\r\n<b>Business Plan</b>\r\n\r\nStill chugging away at it. Do you remember when I wrote that <a href=\"13\">one post</a> about how much I hated writing the business plan? Those were the days, eh? As I was going through and changing all the instances of <i>Criterion</i> to <b>Moxie</b>, I decided that the best way to present the plan would be to separate it into three sections: a business plan, marketing plan, and financial plan. It seems to me that three 13 to 15 page sections would be a little easier to swallow than one 40 page monster. I've learned so much since the last draft. Sometimes, as I'm reading through, I think to myself, \"that has to be the worst sentence you've ever written in your whole entire life. You should be ashamed of yourself. Completely and utterly ashamed. Go over to the couch and cry. No, NO! Don't look at me... just go. GO!\" It's terrible the way I treat myself sometimes.\r\n\r\n<b>Jumping the Gun</b>\r\n\r\n<b>The Moxie</b> has already been listed as Springfield's only independent movie theater by <a href=\"http://www.drury.edu/cinema/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Drury's Cinema Club</a>. For those of you who don't already know, <a href=\"http://www.drury.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Drury</a> is Springfield's premiere private university. It has a student body of roughly 5,000 and is the alma mater of both my dad and my sister. I'm not sure how the webmaster found out about our theater, but I can only assume it was from reading this blog. Here's <a href=\"http://www.drury.edu/cinema/links.html\" target=\"_blank\">the page</a> where we're listed. I'm not mad or anything, just mildly bemused. I wasn't aware that this blog was read by anyone from <a href=\"http://www.drury.edu/cinema/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Drury's Cinema Club</a>, but now that I know... hello, Drury student(s)! Welcome! If you need more information, please feel free to leave a comment... Yippee!\r\n\r\n<b>Beer, Beer, Beer</b>\r\n\r\nI've set up a preliminary relationship with the good people at <a href=\"http://www.wilfischer.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wil Fischer Distributing</a> in Springfield to supply us with beer from Anheuser-Busch, which is a small regional brewery located in St. Louis. In our initial discussions, I informed our representative that we had every intention of offering as wide a variety of beers as possible, not just Bud, Bud Light, and a rotating selection of specialty Michelobs. To my complete and total surprise the representative told me that that wouldn't be a problem at all, in fact, he recommended we try and carry some of Anheuser-Busch's competitors, like Coors and Miller, to help increase sales. That statement completely threw me for a loop, because I was expecting them to have an exclusive contract like with Coke or Pepsi, where if you sign up with one, you can't even look at the other. So, three cheers for having more than three beers! Pabst Blue Ribbon, here we come!\r\n\r\n<b>It's Hot!</b>\r\n\r\nThe heat index outside is currently 106 degrees. It was 78 degrees this time last week. Damn you, Missouri weather! Why can't you just pick a season and stick with it? I'm going to go cry on the couch.",
