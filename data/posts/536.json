  "body": "This last week's been extremely busy, so I apologize for not getting more posts. We had the official walk-through with the city building department on Wednesday at the new location, and it was a breeze... much easier than <a href=\"/post/153\">the last time</a>. The building inspector said the only unexpected item we might have to buy would be a grease accumulator for our bar sink, which won't be too awfully expensive. So, all in all, it was a good week.\r\n\r\nAlso, the April calendar is <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/calendar\" class=\"broken\">online</a> and in print, so swing by and pick one up whenever you get a chance. Have a great weekend everyone!",
