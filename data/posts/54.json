  "body": "A couple of people have been suggesting movie quotes for me to add to the quotation pool, of which one random quote is pulled each and every time this page loads. Well, now's your chance to flood, overwhelm, and/or inunduate me with all your favorite quotes. Come one, come all... well, not quite <i>all</i>. Here's a few rules:<br/><br/><ol><li>Each quote should be accompanied with the name of the character who spoke it and the movie in which it appeared.</li><br/><li>No quotes from Jerry Bruckheimer movies, please. Ok, ok... no, post <i>Con Air</i> quotes. Pre-<i>The Rock</i> quotes are okay, but still looked upon with more than a little bit of reluctance.</li><br/><li>Please don't send me any naked quotes of yourself.</li><br/><li>Pleese make shure their speel-checked pleese.</li></ol><br/>That's it. Give me what you got!",
