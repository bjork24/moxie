  "body": "We're doing a quick poll to determine how our customers access our showtimes. If you have a spare 30 seconds, would you mind heading <a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p14SDG7bXcJ-ODmRBGhWoDw\" class=\"broken\">over here</a> and filling out <a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p14SDG7bXcJ-ODmRBGhWoDw\" class=\"broken\">the poll</a>. I'm sure the majority of you use our online calendar, as you're already on our website reading this post, but feel free to also include any of the other mediums you find helpful.<br/><br/>The information will be used to help us determine the best way for us to advertise our showtimes in the new location. Having two screens will mean we might have to change our monthly print calendar to a monthly, or even bi-weekly summary of upcoming films, without the showtimes. It's going to be a bit of a change, obviously, but I think with everyone's feedback we should be able to create a system that works well for our entire audience.<br/><br/>Thanks for your help!",
