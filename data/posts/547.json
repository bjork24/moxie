  "body": "This is completely not Moxie related, but I need to get something off my chest...\r\n\r\nI've been craving a tzatziki-drenched falafel gyro for the last three days, and apparently no restaurant in Springfield serves them. There WERE three restaurants that USED to serve falafel: Al Roubaie's, Wellspring Cafe, and the Acoustic Cafe, but they've all closed up shop. I called Riad's and Chicago Gyros and Deli to inquire about their falafel-making abilities, but they both acted as if I had asked them if they served poisoned biscuits. Perhaps it's a curse to serve falafel in the Queen City.\r\n\r\nIf anyone out there knows where I can sate my falafel craving, please PLEASE drop me a line. Thank you.",

You can get the whole menu on their website.\r\n\r\nIf you get really desperate, there are a couple of decent Greek places in Branson that may be able to help you out.",
