  "body": "100 days ago today, I sat down and decided to write a blog. Now, roughly 2,400 hours later, I find myself fighting back tears as I reminisce about the good ol' days... back when I thought saying \"Mimosas for everyone!\" was funny... back when I knew where my hat was... back when the summer was young and I was all of 23 years old. Sigh.\r\n\r\nThose days are gone.\r\n\r\nI'd like to think I've matured a little over the last 144,000 minutes. Sure, I still let my hair down and act like an 8 day-old once in awhile , but after all the joshin' and pussy-footin' is through, I settle back into my 8,640,000 second-old blog body and hit the sack. I've got blog kids to feed, you know. I can't be thinking only of myself.\r\n\r\nEven though I rarely write on the weekends, I've still managed to think of a new post every 1.75 days. Over the last 8,640,000,000 milliseconds, I've served up nearly 30,000 incredibly funny words, including, but not limited to: mimosas, hat, the, fork, five deck platterpus, wizz, and weenus. On average, this blog has seen 504 readers per day, which isn't too bad considering my frequent use of the word weenus.\r\n\r\nIt certainly has been a long, strange journey for us all. I can remember my first comment like it was yesterday....\r\n\r\n<i><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/profile/2785021\" target=\"_blank\">Dan</a> says...\r\nTesting the comments. I'm testing. I am Dan and I am testing. Blah blah blah blah. Testing the <b>bold</b> tags. Blah. Blah blah. Weenus.</i>\r\n\r\nThose were the days.\r\n\r\n<b>It's Was a Very Good Blog</b>\r\n\r\nWhen the blog was seventeen (days old)\r\nIt was a very good blog\r\nIt was a very good blog for me, <a href=\"http://jglow.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Justin</a>, and <a href=\"http://tapioca.urlblue.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken\">Nicole</a>\r\nAnd a warm buttered roll\r\nMy posts were silly and pithy\r\nNothing ryhmes with pithy\r\nWhen the blog was seventeen\r\n\r\nWhen the blog was twenty-one (days old)\r\nIt was a very good blog\r\nIt was a very good blog for blogger's \"Blogs of Note\"\r\nWhich I hadn't heard of before\r\nCause I'm an intellectual bore\r\nI once ran into a door\r\nWhen the blog was twenty-four (\"one\" doesn't rhyme as well as \"four\")\r\n\r\nWhen the blog was thirty-five (days old)\r\nIt was a very good blog\r\nIt was a very good blog for talking about theater names\r\nAnd singing karaoke with British dames\r\nWhile watching the Cardinals games\r\nAnd wishing I was Corey Haim(s)\r\nWhen the blog was thirty-five\r\n\r\nBut now the days grow short\r\nThe blog is in the autumn of the day\r\nWhich equates to being roughly 6:43 PM\r\nBut the blog will go on\r\nBecause my name is actually Don\r\nAnd my wife's named Shafon\r\nThose last two lines are wrong\r\n\r\nIt was a mess of good days\r\nWeenus.",

And I can't wait to go see a movie at the Moxie -- and I'm serious, I think all of us would love to fly to [where-ever your art-house is...] just to see a film at your theatre. Keep it up.

I'll probably be around for at least another 15,000 days.\r\n\r\nSybille, thanks for reading.\r\n\r\nEina, don't put your weenus too close to the pussy-foot or else Google will have a cow!",
