  "body": "Not much to report today, mainly because I've been laid up with a cruddy summer cold. I took the night off tonight to convalesce, so I'm sure I'll be back on my feet tomorrow. Other than that, I wanted to mention two things:<br/><br/>First, since our opening date has been pushed back, I think I'm going to lay off blogging on the weekends until we get closer to the big day. Otherwise, the next two posts will look like this:<br/><br/><b>T-Minus 25 Days:</b> It's Saturday. Everything was closed. Worked on website, listened to Cardinals game, and ate sunflower seeds. More later.<br/><br/><b>T-Minus 24 Days:</b> See yesterday's post.<br/><br/>So, for the time being, expect progress updates Monday through Friday, with the assurance that weekend posts are on their way.<br/><br/>Secondly, we've added (at least) two weeks to our closing date at the original location. We'll be showing BRIDESHEAD REVISITED from September 3rd through 16th, and AMERICAN TEEN on the 9th through 16th. We're going to try to keep the original Moxie open as long as possible to insure as little downtime as we can muster. Here are the previews for both films:<br/><br/><b>BRIDESHEAD REVISITED</b><br/><br/><object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/X0Xql3fDM44&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/X0Xql3fDM44&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object><br/><br/><b>AMERICAN TEEN</b><br/><br/><object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BN0Db49y5Ss&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BN0Db49y5Ss&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object><br/><br/>Have a good weekend, and we'll see you on Monday!",
