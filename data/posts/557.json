Apparently they're not waiting on the sprinkler install any longer. Both auditoriums are nearly 100% sheetrocked, the bathrooms are starting to take shape, and all that lacks on the electrical work is installing switches and outlets. It's a good day indeed.\r\n\r\nIn hopes of repenting for my missed post yesterday, I filmed a few shots of the new place today to give everyone a better idea of where we're at. Check it out:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/WJj0w_NccwA&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/WJj0w_NccwA&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAnd that's it for me today. I'll be back tomorrow with more info regarding our sound equipment and chairs.",
