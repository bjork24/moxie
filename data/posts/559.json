Steve G., famed Moxie photog, has posted several new pictures of the progress at Moxie 2.0 -- <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/87104832@N00/sets/72157606446460571/\">check them out here!</a> Despite having some sort of mental condition that causes him to be a Cubs fan, Steve takes some pretty nice pictures. Thanks again!<br/><br/>That's it for today's very special holiday post. Here's hoping we see some serious labor* at the new place over the next few weeks!<br/><br/>*If you're at least nine months pregnant, please stop by our new location over the coming weeks.",
