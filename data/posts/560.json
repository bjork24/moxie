  "body": "Went to the new space today, but didn't see much visual progress. I know stuff was getting done, however, as there were several workers going from room to room, pushing and probing wires into the walls. Any progress is good progress at this point, whether I can immediately see it or not.<br/><br/>We also set a date for our business loan closing (Thursday), which means money is about to squirt out of my nose like a roman candle. POOF (wad of cash for audio equipment)... POOF (wad of cash for bar equipment)... POOF (wad of cash for projection equipment)... POOF (you get the idea). I know I've said it before, but it bears repeating: I hate spending money!<br/><br/><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2369/2140416768_1ee92bcd95.jpg\" alt=\"bears repeating\" /><br/><br/>In other news, we made an offer on a house today... and have a tentative agreement. Crazy, I know. As if moving the theater weren't enough of a stress, we have to go and toss one more life-changing event onto the heap. Heart-attack-inducing stress levels or not, I'm excited to (maybe) be moving into a house. Seeing as how this is NOT my personal blog (I don't have one), I won't go into further detail. I just wanted to give everyone an idea why Nicole and I will be poorer than Socrates' sandal for the next 30 years.<br/><br/>Still... it's exciting. Moving a home and a business is good times.",
