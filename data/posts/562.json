  "body": "Quite an exciting post tonight. I just heard back from our contractor that things are finally starting to take shape at Moxie 2.0. Sprinkler work will commence tomorrow, and, if everything goes smoothly, should be finished on Wednesday or before. If that's the case, the painters will come in on Thursday and start doing what they do best... PAINTING! We'll be meeting with our contractor, architect, and painter on Tuesday, and they've promised to have a finishing schedule for us by then.\r\n\r\nIsn't that great?!\r\n\r\nThat means we can start our work at the end of the month, and hopefully have at least one of the auditoriums (most likely the large one) ready to go by the first of the month. Of course, not having known any of this yesterday, we went ahead and booked more films at our current location up through the beginning of October. But now I can say, with a greater level of certainty, that our last three films will be: VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, PATTI SMITH: DREAM OF LIFE, and... CHOKE! I can't think of a bigger movie to host for our last hurrah. In case you're not familiar with these films, here are their trailers:\r\n\r\nVICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"349\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2gYTEWGVYwg&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D18\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2gYTEWGVYwg&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D18\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nPATTI SMITH: DREAM OF LIFE\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"349\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3ckhFTpMCNk&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D18\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3ckhFTpMCNk&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D18\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nCHOKE\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"349\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/yMZ3Mi1vT-w&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D18\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/yMZ3Mi1vT-w&hl=en&fs=1&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1&ap=%2526fmt%3D18\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"349\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nA Woody Allen film, a documentary, and a potential crossover hit... that's quintessential Moxie right there. And between the two non-documentaries, we have half the cast of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN! I think that's a good sign.\r\n\r\nAlso, since we're going to be open on our three year anniversary (September 21), we're planning on possibly hosting a secret open house at the new location. We'll keep you updated!\r\n\r\nThings are about to happen, ladies and gentleman... thanks for your patience.",
