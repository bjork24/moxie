  "body": "This whole \"writing a new post every day\" gig... I'm not very cut out for it. I know, I'm terrible. But at least I try! Sometimes the thought of sitting down and writing about my day seems overwhelming, which is pretty pathetic, I know. Either way, I think I'm going to do a video blog today.
