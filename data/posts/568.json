  "body": "Today has been long, hard, and scratchy. I'm sorry, but there's no other non-phallic-imagery-inducing way to say it. We had close to 30 high school students swing by this morning (at 8am) to watch AMERICAN TEEN, then I spent the rest of the day helping my dad insulate the drain pipes that hang over the Moxie's new lobby, before taking a quick shower and coming in to work for the remainder of the evening.<br/><br/>The sad thing about all the work dad and I did today, is that if we did the job right (which we did, of course), no one will notice our handy work. Why? Because no one will hear the gentle sound of water trickling overhead while they relax in our lobby, and so will then incorrectly think that the lobby has always been water-trickling-noise-free, which is not the case, dear reader. Not at all.<br/><br/>Now my skin is on fire, thanks to the millions of pieces of fiberglass embedded in it... as well as my eyes. Sigh. What a day. Painting starts tomorrow though. Woo hoo! More to come, folks. More to come.",
