  "body": "Nicole and I drove all over Springfield yesterday and today in an attempt to sate our need for both flooring and furniture. It was a long and arduous trip, nearly resulting in divorce on several occasions, but I think we've finally figured things out. The flooring is going to be a mix of refinished concrete (lobby / bathrooms / auditoriums) and Flor carpet tiles (hallway leading to the theaters / aisles); the furniture is going sparse at first, but we'll fill it in as time and budget permits.<br/><br/>My dad has finished building the Cinebar frame, which means we should be installing it sometime this weekend. The painters will be finished tomorrow, the drop ceilings will be finished the day after that, and over half of the fixtures have been set. I know I've said it before, but things are REALLY getting hot and heavy now. Nic <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/danicole/sets/72157606984020516/\">took a few pictures</a> when we were at the space today. Check them out here (they're the last five). Steve, our official Moxie photo, and soon-to-be-disappointed-Cubs-fan, is going to snap some new pictures over the next two days, so I'll be sure to post a link to those once they go up.<br/><br/>CHOKE has done so well over its first week, we're seriously considering adding a third week of just evening shows. That way Nicole and I can work at the new theater, like we already had plans, but keep a little bit of income streaming in from the last few shows. It won't have any affect on our opening in late October, so I don't see how it could hurt. We'll know for sure on Friday, and let you know then.",
