I'm duly impressed with his ability to consistently frame up such good pictures despite all the tears he must have in his eyes from being a Cub's fan. Thanks Steve!<br/><br/>Nicole is buying supplies for some accent painting she plans to do over the weekend, and we're still planning on installing the frame for the new Cinebar on Sunday. Things are on the up and up! More to come, of course.<br/><br/>Have a great weekend!",
