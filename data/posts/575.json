  "body": "It was a very busy and productive weekend. Nicole painted a huge accent wall, and my dad's massive Cinebar was put in its place. In fact, I'm getting ready to head over to the new place to help him level it, square it, and then bolt it into place. It's going to look fantastic when it's 100% finished.<br/><br/>Most of the lights have been installed at this point. We're just lacking a few spot lights for the art wall, and two massive, attention-grabbing, historic chandeliers that used to hang at The Bar Next Door, and the Buffalo Bar on Commercial street before that. Transporting all the glass globes might prove to be a bit tricky, but luckily we don't have to take them very far.<br/><br/>After tonight's big project of leveling the bar, my next job will be finishing the floor in the projection booth. I bought all the plywood for the second layer of subfloor, and the vinyl composite tile will be ready to pick up very soon. We'll take pictures as things progress.<br/><br/>On a completely different note, I noticed something in <a href=\"http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081006/NEWS01/810060371\">an article</a> that ran in today's paper. Louise Whall from the city was quoted saying \"that's 2,200 people if they sold out all 14 theaters.\" That's not a lot of seats for a 14 screen theater. In fact, it's only an average of 157 per auditorium. Springfield 8 has the exact same amount of total seats, but they also have six fewer screens (giving them an average of 275 seats per auditorium). Our large auditorium might end up being the same size as several of the auditoriums at the new downtown theater. Very interesting indeed.<br/><br/>More to come!",
