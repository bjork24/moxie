It's going to be close, but I think we can pull it off. Everything that's required to show movies and sell concessions will be finished by Wednesday. The other stuff, like curtains, holes in the wall, hand rails, etc, may take a few extra days.\r\n\r\nUh oh, I'm needed in the booth. More to come!",
