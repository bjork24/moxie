It came as quite a shock when we got the call from the Weinstein Company yesterday, specifically asking us to show the film on Friday. It's cool enough having one super award-magnet (SLUMDOG), but two... at the same time!!! It's going to be an awesome weekend.\r\n\r\nIn other news, I have a weird cyst on my thumb joint. My diagnosis is ganglion cyst, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were a physically-manifested stress BB either. The only thing it affects is my bowling game, but I think I'll pull through.\r\n\r\nAs for theater news, we're still plugging along at the new location. We're creeping closer and closer to the 100% finished line, which is fan-freaking-tastic! I finally cleaned and organized my office / storage room, so no it's much more comfortable do here in \"the hole.\" Other than that, we're just cruising right along.\r\n\r\nUh oh.... movie's over. MORE LATER!",
