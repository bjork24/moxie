  "body": "If you haven't heard of this exciting campaign, then let us be the one to inform you!<br/><br/>[ MISSING IMAGE ]<br/><br/>The Downtown Springfield Association, in conjunction with 16 downtown restaurants and two downtown movie theaters (Hollywood & Moxie), are working together to provide an affordable evening out on the town!<br/><br/>If you order an entree at any of the participating business (see below), you can purchase a movie ticket for only $5! That's a $3 savings from evening Moxie shows.<br/><br/>We're really excited to be part of this campaign, and since its launch last weekend, we've seen a ton of passes come back, and a lot of new faces. <br/><br/>So this weekend, before you catch EASY VIRTUE, SUGAR, or VALENTINO, treat yourself to dinner beforehand, and get your tickets on the cheap. But make sure you save room for concessions!<br/><br/>Participating restaurants:<br/><br/>• Big Whiskey’s<br/>• Fedora<br/>• Flame<br/>• French Quarter Café<br/>• Kai<br/>• Lili’s (located in Wilhoit Plaza, close to The Moxie)<br/>• Maria’s<br/>• Mille’s<br/>• Nonna’s<br/>• Rendezvous Coffee House<br/>• Riad’s<br/>• South Avenue Pizza<br/>• Springfield Brewing Company<br/>• St. Michael’s<br/>• Trolley’s<br/>• Ziggie’s<br/><br/>The pilot project is for a limited time and will be offered through August 31, 2009.<br/><br/>For more information, you can also visit The DSA's website, <a href=\"http://www.itsalldowntown.com/articles/253\" class=\"broken\">It's All Downtown</a>.",
