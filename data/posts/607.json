That's a $3 savings from evening Moxie shows.\r\n\r\nWe're really excited to be part of this campaign, and since its launch last weekend, we've seen a ton of passes come back, and a lot of new faces. \r\n\r\nSo this weekend, before you catch EASY VIRTUE, SUGAR, or VALENTINO, treat yourself to dinner beforehand, and get your tickets on the cheap. But make sure you save room for concessions!\r\n\r\nParticipating restaurants:\r\n\r\n• Big Whiskey’s\r\n• Fedora\r\n• Flame\r\n• French Quarter Café\r\n• Kai\r\n• Lili’s (located in Wilhoit Plaza, close to The Moxie)\r\n• Maria’s\r\n• Mille’s\r\n• Nonna’s\r\n• Rendezvous Coffee House\r\n• Riad’s\r\n• South Avenue Pizza\r\n• Springfield Brewing Company\r\n• St. Michael’s\r\n• Trolley’s\r\n• Ziggie’s\r\n\r\nThe pilot project is for a limited time and will be offered through August 31, 2009.\r\n\r\nFor more information, you can also visit The DSA's website, <a href=\"http://www.itsalldowntown.com/articles/253\" class=\"broken\">It's All Downtown</a>.",
