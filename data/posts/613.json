Right? \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, here are some other options:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.thebluenote.com/\">Tuesday October 27th, 9:30p @ The Blue Note in Columbia, MO</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.landmarktheatres.com/Films/films_frameset.asp?id=17329\">Friday October 30th & 31st, Midnight @ The Tivoli in St. Louis</a></li>\r\n<li>Last year a few local bars and clubs also did screenings, so as we hear about them, we'll post them here.</li></ul>\r\nIf you know of any other RHPS events in the region, feel free to write about them in the comments section, and I'll put it on the blog post. \r\n\r\nSee all you Rocky Fans next year!\r\n\r\n",
