  "body": "Here at The Moxie, we like to experiment with our film programming. One of the things we like to do is give some films a 'second chance,' meaning that we pick up some of the giant multiplex films that have more of an art-house appeal. We're extremely selective on which films we choose to do this with - some recent films have been SUNSHINE CLEANING, AWAY WE GO, and THE HURT LOCKER. This week, we're adding Michael Moore's new documentary, CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY.\r\n\r\nWhen we add these (at least in our new space), it's usually a last-minute decision, with not much time for marketing. So here we are, announcing that if you missed it the first time around, come check it out at The Moxie! Dates and showtimes are <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/films/458\" class=\"broken\">linked here</a>.",
