We rarely do this, but it seems every January we have to cut out a show or two due to ice and snow.<br/><br/>So, tonight ME AND ORSON WELLES at 9pm and A SINGLE MAN at 9:15pm are CANCELED. The early shows (ORSON WELLES @ 6:30p & YOUNG VICTORIA @ 6:45p are still being shown).<br/><br/>Thank you for understanding! ",
