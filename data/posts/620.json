  "body": "The Moxie (and Springfield, of course) lost one of its favorite customers / artists this month, Robert E Smith. We'll miss seeing him around town, and serving him a diet root beer, of which he'd only take one sip, hand back to us, and then ask us to call him a cab. \r\n\r\nOther fond memories include him singing Christmas Carols in the auditorium one November night, and dressing up as Santa for his screening of <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/films/276\" class=\"broken\">\"To and From.\"</a>\r\n\r\nWe feel lucky to have known Robert, and send his family and close friends our condolences. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/2922/robertp.jpg\">\r\n<i>Robert E Smith standing in front of his Moxie gallery show in November 2005</i>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/pix/misc/moxie_theatre_lobby.jpg\">\r\n<i>Moxie Theatre Lobby 2006</i>",
