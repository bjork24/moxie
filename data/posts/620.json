  "body": "The Moxie (and Springfield, of course) lost one of its favorite customers / artists this month, Robert E Smith. We'll miss seeing him around town, and serving him a diet root beer, of which he'd only take one sip, hand back to us, and then ask us to call him a cab. <br/><br/>Other fond memories include him singing Christmas Carols in the auditorium one November night, and dressing up as Santa for his screening of <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/films/276\" class=\"broken\">\"To and From.\"</a><br/><br/>We feel lucky to have known Robert, and send his family and close friends our condolences. <br/><br/><img src=\"http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/2922/robertp.jpg\"><br/><i>Robert E Smith standing in front of his Moxie gallery show in November 2005</i><br/><br/><img src=\"/pix/misc/moxie_theatre_lobby.jpg\"><br/><i>Moxie Theatre Lobby 2006</i>",
