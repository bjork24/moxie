So, in the spirit of indie craft shows (think The Renegade Craft Fair, Strange Folk, etc), we decided to have a mini craft show in The Moxie's lobby!<br/><br/>This is a call to all our crafty customers out there. Got a hidden talent for making something special and unique that you want to sell? Learn more at <a href=\"http://whollycraftshow.com/\" class=\"broken\">the craft show blog</a> and <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/whollycraft\" class=\"broken\">sign up!</a> If you mention this blog post in the application, we'll extend the deadline until April 9. Spaces are limited, though, so let us know soon.<br/>",
