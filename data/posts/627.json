  "body": "For the second year in a row, we're hosting a Mommy Matinee with the film <a href=\"http://www.moxiecinema.com/films/506\" class=\"broken\">BABIES!</a>\r\n\r\nMost of you missed our debut Mommy Matinee last year, with SUNSHINE CLEANING, so this year we're going to kick off the summer with a little lighter fare for all the Mamas out there who desperately need their indie film fix!\r\n\r\nThe Mommy Matinee is a special screening for Moms, Dads, Grandparents, Nannies...anyone who wants to come watch an independent film, but can't leave the baby behind. Children are welcome, and parents won't have to stress about fussy babies.\r\n\r\nWhile the film is playing in Auditorium Two, the other auditorium will have dimmed lights and soft music, and can be used as a cry station or discreet nursing/changing area. We'll even provide the wet wipes! First come, first served basis.\r\n\r\nPlease help spread the word on this. Ideally, we'd like this to be a monthly event (maybe even bi-monthly!), especially because no other theater in town provides this opportunity! But in order for us to continue, we need to fill those seats!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/1016/jaspere.jpg\" width=\"400\">\r\n\r\n",
