  "body": "Nicole and I have been invited to attend a forum discussion about film in Midwestburg. I'm not sure how big of a role we'll be playing in the actual forum itself, but it will give us a chance to meet other like-minded individuals and build stronger networks with those who control the MONEY... to say the least. We're very excited about it. I even bought a new shirt at TJ Max just for the occasion... it's the first new shirt I've purchased in well over 8 years. Since the forum falls on a weekday, June 14th to be exact, we'll have to take off work to attend, but that shouldn't pose a problem as Nicole and I have lots of vacation days left.<br/><br/>We're still hammering away at the ol' business plan. If all goes well, we should be done with the mini-plan tonight. Our mini-plan is a condensed version of the full-sized plan; it focuses more on concept rather than financials. Nicole spent the entire holiday weekend compiling an incredibly detailed start-up list for our concession area, office, lobby, etc.. I spent the time reworking our financial projection worksheet, which I sent to Andrew last night. He's going to take a look at it and let us know how much more detailed we need it to be before we can start approaching banks. I'll keep posting progress as new updates warrant.<br/><br/>We also received estimates on insurance today: $1000 per quarter for insurance, and $800 for worker's compensation. That's a lot less than I was expecting, so all is good!",
