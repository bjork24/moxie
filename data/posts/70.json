  "body": "Hello again! Thanks to a lot of elbow work and hard grease, our business plan is 97% finished. I'm still waiting on a revised quote from our equipment dealer, or else it would be 100% completed. We're going to send out drafts to a few friends and family members tonight, and if all goes well, mail out the completed draft on Friday.<br/><br/>It feels like a tremendous weight has been lifted from my shoulders! Today is a good day, and I hope there's many more to come.<br/><br/><b>::: THE 4 WORD MOXIE STORY :::</b><br/><br/>The Moxie is so rad, dude. That's because it rhymes with epoxy. Hey, what's that smell? I know, it's the popcorn that smells like chocolate marshmallows. Did you know that Dan wears black and red biker shorts, on his head? Isn't anyone going to point out that Nicole walked out and then decided to tell Dan to have a ball with the business plan. Trouble in Paradise?<br/><br/>I can't believe it's not time to go to another website, because I'm on my way to buy porn and chicken rings from White Castle! But The Moxie will destroy anyone who tries to poison, and destroy or even masticate the very essence of the person's earlobes. Seriously though, where's Dan's hat? Jello jiggles, like that thing that is hanging from my left buttock. Perhaps you should get that bag of wrenches out from under your greasy hat.<br/><br/>And speaking of the movie-going public, doesn't the Moxie sound like a person throwing a big, grandiose birhtday cake in someone else's art-house theatre; notwithstanding, all of the other snake bitten Aussie folk foam the rabid electric current. What if Dan the man had a plan to underhand the can of GOD DAMN! Peter Piper picked a pair of biker shorts.<br/><br/>Chicken rings are tasty treats for camera men who like to shoot heroin in the dark. But then the lights come up and then policemen raid the moxie where they find monkeys eating popcorn and drinking awesome local brew beer. \"Oh no!,\" the policeman yelled as he reached nirvana, \"I forgot to have some delicious Moxie-flavored zen before work, perhaps I should squeeze it from my cattle!\" But Nicole said, \"No Dan, back and forth!\" The cow's teats were moist and oh so kissable. YAY! THE END<br/><br/><b>::: ROLL CREDITS :::</b><br/><br/>Thanks for playing along.",

Because you know, you can never start planning that early enough.  I recommend something that proclaims the writer's manhood, followed by instructions on how best to contact persons unknown for sexual gratification.  Finally, you can't go wrong with the classic, \"Here I sit so broken-hearted...\"  That one always kills at GraffCon.",
