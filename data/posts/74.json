I don't know how you do it, but this guy did it:  http://projectpedal.blogspot.com , so his hyperlink goes right to his idea.  I went through about 50 ideas looking for the Moxie so that I could \"feel it,\" but I never saw it.  Then I tried to search for \"Moxie,\" \r\n\"Movie,\" and \"Theater,\" and still got squat.  If you can put up a direct link, I'll vote for you!  (I'm sure everyone else would too.)",

I also made track marks on my arms in honor of Slash's heroin habit, but I had no idea what they should look like and just drew lines along some of the veins.  Good thing there were no real heroin addicts at the party or they might have attacked me.  Luckily they would have been too sickly to do any real damage.",
