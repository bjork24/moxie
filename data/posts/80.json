I'll be in touch with you next week.\r\n<b>Dan & Nicole</b> - Wee!\r\n\r\nMonday, October 18, 2004\r\nSetting: Dan's e-mail\r\n\r\nFrom: <b>Ann</b>\r\nTo: <b>Dan</b>\r\n\r\nDan,\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't give you a loan for 100% of your required start-up need. We act more as a secondary source for financing. You'll need to contact a conventional financial institution to secure your primary financing.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnn\r\n\r\nTuesday, October 19, 2004\r\nSetting: Dan's phone\r\nCharacter: <i>Brian</i> - President of the SFDC board AND SBA loan officer for a regional financial institution\r\n\r\n<b>Dan</b> - We need money... something fierce.\r\n<b>Brian</b> - I can help.\r\n<b>Dan</b> - Do we need to fill out papers?\r\n<b>Brian</b> - No, the forms you filled out for Ann should be enough for us to base our decision on. If we approve the project, then you'll have to fill out some standard SBA documents.\r\n<b>Dan</b> - Great!\r\n<b>Brian</b> - We can split your loan $40,000 SBA / $35,000 SFDC, but you'll need to come up with $10,000 in injected capital. Is that doable?\r\n<b>Dan</b> - No problem.\r\n<b>Brian</b> - Great. I'll talk to you again later this week.\r\n\r\n*click*\r\n\r\n<b>Dan</b> - (to Nicole) We need 10,000 dollars by the end of this week.\r\n<b>Nicole</b> - *gulp*\r\n\r\n[ <i>cut to: Nicole on street corner</i> ]\r\n\r\n<b>Nicole</b> - (bends over and leans into the car window) Hey baby, you looking for a good time?\r\n<b>Dan</b> - Yes! Now get in the car before the skating rink closes!\r\n<b>Nicole</b> - Woot woot! (hops in)\r\n\r\n*zoom*\r\n\r\n[ <i>Inside Ricky's Roller Rink</i> ]\r\n\r\n<b>Dan & Nicole</b> - (stomp their roller skates and clap in unison) *clap* *clap* *clap* XANADU! *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* XANADU!\r\n<b>Announcer</b> - And the winner of our $10,000 Xanadu Look Alike Prize is...

I still have to look over your stuff with my main man, Kent. Then we'll decide if you're ready for the money.\r\n<b>Dan</b> - Show me the money.\r\n<b>Brian</b> - You'll hear from me next week. If the Cardinals win, the money's yours, but if the Cardinals lose...\r\n<b>Dan</b> - Yes?\r\n<b>Brian</b> - We'll just have to wait until we see your business plan.\r\n<b>Dan</b> - Oh, you'll see my business plan, alright.\r\n<b>Brian</b> - Good. I'm planning on it.\r\n<b>Dan</b> - Good!\r\n<b>Brian</b> - Good!\r\n<b>Dan</b> - I'll expect your call sometime next week.\r\n<b>Brian</b> - Go CARDS!!\r\n\r\nTuesday, October 26, 2004\r\nSetting: The bathroom\r\n\r\n<b>Dan</b> - (vomits into toliet) BLucK bLUCk GloOSE!\r\n<b>Nicole</b> - It'll be okay sweetie.
