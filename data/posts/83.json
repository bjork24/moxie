I'm watching Sportscenter, and Chris “Boomer” Berman just said, \"A run to remember by the Red Sox, who did it with power, who did it with pitching, and who did it with MOXIE!!!!!!\"  Is it possible that your new arthouse theater in Missouri has enabled the Red Sox to beat your Cardinals??????????",

Of course, I've gotten used to that over the last couple of decades; as long as it's not NY or Atlanta, I can root for anyone.\r\nSo...sorry St.L. lost, but I gotta be happy for my friends in Boston.\r\nAnd yes, Stapp was Awful.",
