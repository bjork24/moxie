Can you even contemplate a country where I can't continually come in to work completely costumed as a creepy cuitar player from Cuns n' Coses? I can't. Geez. Oh well, life goes on, I suppose. It's not like any of the people who did win are starting their own theater or anything! So, in that respect, they're ALL losers.\r\n\r\n*runs aways sobbing*\r\n\r\nI will, however, post a picture-by-picture transformation sometime over the weekend. You'll watch in utter amazement as mild-mannerd Dan becomes STD-riddled Slash! Rock ON!",
