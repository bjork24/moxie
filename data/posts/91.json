Be warned, the pictures are fairly large, so if you're using dial-up the page will take a while to load... of course, if you're using dial-up, you're probably already used to MOST pages taking a while to load. Also, a majority of the pictures feature me in EXTREMELY TIGHT pleather pants, so if you're prone to fainting or currently taking medication for high blood pressure, please view with caution. Tight buttocks abound!\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave your comments on the actual pictorial.",
