  "title": "Growing a beard",
  "body": "I haven't shaved (or is it shaven?) for almost 2 weeks, so I now have a fairly heavy beard clinging to my face. It's itchy and feels like a brillo pad, but I love it SOOOO much. Which brings me to my second point: I almost had a nervous breakdown on Friday... special emphasis on the word <i>almost</i>.\r\n\r\nThroughout the long process of getting the Moxie up and on its feet, our project has faltered on numerous occasions. The project has seemed doomed just as many times as it's seemed a shoe-in, but, as you can probably surmise, the feelings of doom were much easier to handle before we gave our resignation notices. While Friday's revelation doesn't shelve the project forever, it does, once again, throw the fate of the Moxie to the wayward winds... may it fall where it might.\r\n\r\nHere's the lowdown:\r\n\r\nAs you know, we were all but golden after our parents agreed to act as guarantors for the loan. Nicole and I had to pony up $10,000 of our own money, but the loan looked to be all but done. Then the bottom fell out. The bank informed me that someone was going to need to pledge liquefiable assets to secure the loan. Apparently, none of the equipment we were buying with the money could be used as collateral, nor were our parent's signed confirmations good enough to secure the loan. The bank now needed someone to PLEDGE liquefiable assets (i.e. house, cars, boats, horses, etc.) that were worth at least $40,000 so they could have something to repossess immediately on the off-chance of a default.\r\n\r\n*moan*\r\n\r\nI didn't expect either set of parents to do this. In fact, I felt that the demand for additional assets was border-line ridiculous. It's not like we're asking for $750,000 to buy and sell swamp land in Florida! All we need is $75,000, nearly half of which is being used to buy tangible, liquefiable theater equipment. If Nicole and I were applying for a loan for our first house, I guarantee we'd be able to pre-qualify for a $80,000 to $90,000 mortgage... without the need for our parents to co-sign. If Springfield were more of a seller's market, I'd suggest we buy a house and then immediately turn it around and use the money for the theater.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, neither set of parents was willing to pledge additional assets. My mom has been a banker for nearly 30 years â€“ and before you ask, her bank is too small to deal with commercial loans, which is why we didn't go through her in the first place - so she called the SBA loan officer and assured him that her signature would be sufficient to guarantee that they would not default on the loan. No dice. The SBA officer informed her that with a business like ours, someone had, had, HAD to pledge assets totaling up to $40,000. My mom felt terrible, but she had done all she could.\r\n\r\nThat's when I started to lose it. I've dealt with a lot of stress working with this project over the last nine months, but it had never hit me like this. When I read my mom's e-mail, my back and head immediately started to throb. It felt like someone had poured concrete into my body and it was slowly hardening above my lumbar region. I went home for lunch, laid on the bed, and didn't move a muscle for nearly an hour. That hour was the lowest point I've experienced throughout this entire process. Everything felt like it was slipping away at that point. If our parents couldn't secure the loan, who could? Nicole and I couldn't. It seemed like the Moxie was slipping away.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the urging of Nicole and her mom, I decided to write a stunningly desperate e-mail to Brian and plead for his advise. After several exchanges, we came to the tentative agreement of lowering the loan package to $65,000 (35 for equipment, 25 for everything else, 5 for working capital). In this arrangement, Nicole and I still supply the required injected capital, our parents will continue to act as guarantors, but no pledging will be required. However, this doesn't mean we're golden. Brian still has to run th\r\ne new arrangement by the SBA loan officer, who then has to submit it to the SBA for approval. If we get rejected during either one of those steps, we're back to square one.\r\n\r\nMy last e-mail with Brian was on Friday. I'm patiently awaiting his next correspondence, which could come at any time.\r\n\r\nBut as I was saying... I love my beard.\r\n",
