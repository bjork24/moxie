<h1>About the Moxie blog</h1>
<p>The Moxie Blog was originally written by myself (Dan Chilton) and my wife Nicole to chronicle the process of opening our own arthouse movie theater in downtown Springfield, Missouri. The first post was written on May 24, 2004, and over the course of the first year, the blog saw our tiny idea transform from a pipe dream to a reality in the shape of Moxie Cinema. Before we had even opened our doors to the public, I had already written over 300 posts covering every trial, tribulation, and triumph we encountered on the road to becoming Springfield's premiere independent cinema.</p>
<p>As the theater grew, so did the blog; adding new features like the <a href="/guestbook">guestbook</a>, <a href="/phlogs">phlog</a>, and <a href="/episodes">all-too-short-lived MoxieTV</a>. Over the final years of our ownership, the blog became less a chronicle of our experiences and more of a marketing tool to drive people to the theater, before eventually being supplanted by the use of popular social networks. Along the way, the Moxie Blog was chosen by Blogger (the platform it originally began on) as a "Blog of Note," featured in Yahoo's blogging spotlight, mentioned in the New York Times, linked to by SXSW and MetaFilter, and led to Nicole and I being asked to write a recurring column about start-ups for Inc Magazines's website.</p>
<h1>About the archive</h1>
<p>After the sale of the Moxie in August 2010, the original website was passed from one server to the next. During one of the moves, a few mod_rewrites were lost in the shuffle and, as a result, the blog stopped working correctly. When I learned that The Moxie's website was going to be redesigned, I was struck by a powerful wave of nostalgia, so I asked the new ownership about reviving the original blog on my personal website. They were happy to oblige, so I spent a few week's worth of free time collecting, rebuilding, and sanitizing the old data, culminating in this archive.</p>
<p>I combed through every post, making sure links pointed to the correct archived data and labeling broken links to external sites as I found them. As you read through older posts, please note that <a href="">active links look like this</a>, while <a href="" class="broken">broken links look like so</a> <i> -- note: I didn't check links that appeared in the comments, so click those at your own risk</i>.</p>
<p>I made sure to leave the content exactly as it appeared on the original blog; I did not correct typos, change dates, remove bad jokes, or engage in any revisionist modifications. I also chose to use a stark, minimal design for the archive, as I won't be continually tweaking the blog as I did when it lived on <a href="http://www.moxiecinema.com">Moxie Cinema's</a> website.</p>
<p>I'm proud to point out that <a href="http://www.moxiecinema.com">The Moxie</a> is still going strong, and continues to be one of the most prominent art-driven businesses in downtown Springfield. I'm incredibly proud to have been a part of The Moxie, and maintain this archive as part of my dedication to the greatest little cinema in the whole entire world.</p>
