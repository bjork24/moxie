<h1>Ye olde guestbook</h1>

<p>Remember when having a guestbook on your website was a thing? No? Well, I do, and this page stands as proof that the Moxie Blog had one of the best guestbooks around.</p>

<div class="m-comments">
  <h2>The Guestbook</h2>
  <ol>
    {{#entries}}
    <li>
      <b>{{ author }}</b>
      <p>{{{ body }}}</p>
      <i>{{ time }}</i>
    </li>
    {{/entries}}
